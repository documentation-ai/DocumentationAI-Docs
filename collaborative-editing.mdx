jobs:
  update-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Extract API Changes
        run: docai extract-changes --pr ${{ github.event.number }}
      - name: Generate Documentation Updates
        run: docai generate --changes ./api-changes.json
      - name: Create Documentation PR
        run: docai create-pr --target documentation-repo
```

## Best Practices for Team Collaboration

### Establish Clear Guidelines

Set expectations for collaborative work:
