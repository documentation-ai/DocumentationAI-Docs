## Overview

Analytics gives you a high‑level understanding of how people use your documentation. It helps you answer questions such as:

- How many users visit your docs, and how engaged are they?
- Which pages get the most attention?
- What are users searching for, and are they finding what they need?
- Where do users leave feedback, and what does it tell you about your content quality?

## What you can track

You can access Analytics from the sidebar. It currently includes two primary data groups: user behaviour metrics and documentation feedback.

Use these metrics to understand how readers navigate, where they get stuck, and how effectively your content answers their questions.

## User behaviour analytics

User behaviour analytics provides an at‑a‑glance view of how readers interact with your documentation over time. You will see:

- Pageviews and unique sessions
- Average session duration
- Bounce rate and other engagement indicators
- Top content by traffic source and popularity

## Documentation feedback

Documentation feedback analytics shows how users feel about your content and specific pages. You can monitor:

- Page‑level satisfaction trends
- Likes and dislikes
- Pages where users most often express confusion or frustration

  User feedback is a powerful signal for prioritizing updates, evaluating unclear topics, and validating whether recent improvements are helping readers.
