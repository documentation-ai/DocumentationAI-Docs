## Overview

Analytics gives you a high-level view of how people use your documentation so you can improve it over time. It helps you answer questions such as:

- How many users visit your docs, and how engaged are they?

- Which pages get the most attention?

- What are users searching for, and are they finding what they need?

- Where do users leave feedback, and what does it tell you about content quality?

## What you can track

You can open Analytics from the sidebar. It currently includes two main data groups:

- **User behavior metrics** — how people discover, navigate, and engage with your docs.

- **Feedback** — how people feel about specific pages and changes.

Use these metrics to understand how readers move through your docs, where they get stuck, and how effectively your content answers their questions.

## User behaviormetrics

User behavior analytics provides an at-a-glance view of how readers interact with your documentation over time, including:

- Pageviews and unique sessions

- Average session duration

- Bounce rate and other engagement indicators

- Top content by traffic source and popularity

- Page-level satisfaction trends

- Likes and dislikes

- Pages where users most often express confusion or frustration
