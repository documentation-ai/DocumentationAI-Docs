# Writing with AI

Transform your documentation workflow with AI-powered writing assistance. Learn how to collaborate effectively with AI to create clear, comprehensive, and engaging documentation that serves your users better.

## Getting Started with AI Writing

### The AI Writing Interface

Documentation.AI's writing assistant integrates seamlessly into your editing experience:

- **Inline Suggestions**: Real-time recommendations as you type
- **Context Panel**: AI insights and suggestions in a dedicated sidebar
- **Command Palette**: Quick access to AI functions via keyboard shortcuts
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Intelligent completion of sentences and paragraphs

### Your First AI-Assisted Document

Let's create a simple API documentation page with AI assistance:

1. **Start with a Title**: Type "User Authentication API"
2. **Add Context**: The AI will suggest an introduction based on the title
3. **Build Structure**: AI recommends sections like "Endpoints," "Examples," "Errors"
4. **Fill Content**: AI helps generate detailed content for each section

## AI Writing Techniques

### Collaborative Writing Approach

Think of AI as a writing partner, not a replacement:

**Human Strengths:**
- Domain expertise and technical knowledge
- Understanding of user needs and context
- Creative problem-solving and strategic thinking
- Quality judgment and editorial decisions

**AI Strengths:**
- Rapid content generation and expansion
- Consistency across large documents
- Grammar and style optimization
- Research and fact-checking assistance

### Effective Prompting Strategies

Get better results by communicating clearly with the AI:

**Be Specific:**
```markdown
❌ "Write about APIs"
✅ "Write a beginner-friendly explanation of REST API authentication using JWT tokens for mobile app developers"
```

**Provide Context:**
```markdown
❌ "Explain this function"
✅ "Explain this JavaScript function that validates user input for a React form component. The audience is intermediate developers who need to understand both the validation logic and error handling."
```

**Set Constraints:**
```markdown
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Rewrite this section to be more concise (under 200 words) while maintaining all technical details. Use active voice and include a code example."
```
