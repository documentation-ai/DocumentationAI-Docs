title: Authentication
description: "Protect your documentation with authentication, including full and partial access modes."

## Overview

Control access to your documentation by requiring visitors to authenticate before they can view protected content.

Authentication is configured in the dashboard and takes effect after you publish (or re-publish) your documentation.

## Authentication modes

Documentation.AI supports three access modes:

- **Public**: All visitors can access the entire site without authentication.
- **Full Authentication**: All pages require authentication.
- **Partial Authentication**: Some pages are public, and the rest require authentication.

<Callout kind="info">
  Password authentication is available on paid plans.
  JWT and OAuth 2.0 authentication are available on Enterprise plans.
</Callout>

## Configure authentication

Use the dashboard to choose an authentication method and mode.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password" icon="key">
    <Callout kind="info">
      Password authentication provides access control only and does not support user-level personalization.
    </Callout>

    ### Prerequisites

    - You can securely share a single password with the people who should have access.

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Choose an authentication mode" icon="shield-check">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Authentication** and select one of:

        - **Full Authentication** to protect the entire site
        - **Partial Authentication** to make some pages public and protect the rest
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set a password" icon="key">
        In **Authentication Method**, choose **Password**, then set a strong password.

        - If you already have a password configured, leaving the password field blank keeps the current password.
        - Use **Clear password** only if you intend to remove password protection.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Re-publish to apply changes" icon="upload">
        After saving authentication settings, re-publish your documentation so the deployed site uses the updated configuration.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Distribute access" icon="users">
        Securely share the docs URL and password with authorized users.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host documentation at `docs.example.com` and want basic access control without managing individual user accounts. Use **Password** authentication and share the password with authorized teammates.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT (Enterprise)" icon="key-round">
    <Callout kind="info">
      JWT authentication is available on Enterprise plans.
    </Callout>

    ### Prerequisites

    - You have an authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
    - You have a backend service that can create redirect URLs back to your docs.

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure JWT settings in the dashboard" icon="settings">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Authentication** and enable authentication.

        In **Authentication Method**, choose **JWT**, then configure your login URL (your existing login flow).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate a signing key" icon="key">
        Generate a key in the dashboard and store it securely where your backend can access it.

        Rotate keys using your established security process (for example, during incident response or scheduled rotation).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate the docs callback into your login flow" icon="arrow-right">
        After a user successfully authenticates in your system:

        - Create a JWT for that user (per the format required by Documentation.AI).
        - Sign the JWT using the algorithm required by Documentation.AI.
        - Redirect the user back to your docs site using the callback URL shown in the dashboard, including the signed JWT (the dashboard will show the exact callback format).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Preserve the user’s intended destination (recommended)" icon="map">
        When an unauthenticated user tries to visit a protected page, preserve their target path through your login flow using a `redirect` query parameter, then redirect back to the docs callback URL with the same `redirect`.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host docs at `docs.example.com` and your company login is `https://login.example.com`. Configure **JWT** authentication so users sign in with your existing identity system, then return to the docs site.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0 (Enterprise)" icon="shield">
    <Callout kind="info">
      OAuth 2.0 authentication is available on Enterprise plans.
    </Callout>

    ### Prerequisites

    - An OAuth 2.0 or OIDC provider that supports the Authorization Code flow.

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure OAuth in the dashboard" icon="settings">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Authentication** and enable authentication.

        In **Authentication Method**, choose **OAuth 2.0**, then configure:

        - **Authorization URL**
        - **Token URL**
        - **Client ID**
        - **Client Secret**
        - **Scopes** (optional, if your provider requires them)
        - **User info URL** (optional, if your flow needs a separate user info fetch)
        - **Logout URL** (optional)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Register the redirect URL with your provider" icon="link">
        Copy the redirect/callback URL shown in the dashboard and add it to your OAuth provider’s allowed redirect URLs.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Re-publish to apply changes" icon="upload">
        After saving authentication settings, re-publish your documentation so the deployed site uses the updated configuration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host docs at `docs.example.com` and use an existing OAuth provider for user sign-in. Configure **OAuth 2.0** authentication so visitors authenticate via your provider before accessing protected pages.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Partial authentication page visibility

In **Partial Authentication** mode, Documentation.AI determines whether a page is **Public** or **Protected** using the `public` flag on navigation nodes in `documentation.json`.

### Inheritance rules

- **Default**: If no `public` flag is set anywhere, pages are treated as **Protected** in partial mode.
- **Closest wins**: The closest (nearest) explicit `public` flag in the navigation tree determines the effective visibility for that node and its subtree.
- **Explicit override**: A child node can override its parent by setting its own `public` flag.

### Visibility values

- **Inherit**: Do not set `public` on the node (the effective value comes from the nearest parent that has `public`).
- **Public**: `public: true`
- **Protected**: `public: false`

## public in documentation.json

The `public` property is an **optional boolean** that can be set on any navigation node (containers like groups/dropdowns/tabs/etc., and individual pages).

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Guides",
        "public": true,
        "pages": [
          {
            "title": "Overview",
            "path": "guides/overview"
          },
          {
            "title": "Internal Runbook",
            "path": "guides/internal-runbook",
            "public": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Semantics

- **`public: true`**: Marks the node as public and makes its descendants public unless overridden.
- **`public: false`**: Marks the node as protected and makes its descendants protected unless overridden.
- **No `public` field**: The node inherits from its nearest parent that has `public`. If no parent has it, the default is protected in partial mode.
