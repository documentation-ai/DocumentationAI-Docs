## Overview

Control who can view your documentation by configuring access control settings. You can make your documentation public, require authentication for all pages, or configure partial access control where some pages are public and others are protected.

Access control is configured in the dashboard under **Settings → Access Control** and takes effect after you publish (or re-publish) your documentation.

## Access modes

Documentation.AI supports three access modes:

- **Public**: Anyone can access your documentation. No authentication required.
- **Private**: All pages require authentication to access.
- **Partial**: Make some pages public and restrict access to others.

## Authentication methods

Documentation.AI offers three authentication methods to protect your documentation:

<Callout kind="info">
  **Password** authentication requires a Standard plan or higher. **JWT** and **OAuth 2.0** authentication require an Enterprise plan or higher.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password" icon="key">
    <Callout kind="warning">
      Password authentication is available on Standard plans or higher.
    </Callout>

    Password authentication provides simple access control using a shared password. It does not support user-level personalization or individual user tracking.

    ### Prerequisites

    - A Standard plan or higher
    - Ability to securely share a single password with authorized users

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Choose an access mode" icon="shield-check">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Access Control** and select one of:

        - **Private** to protect the entire site
        - **Partial** to make some pages public and protect the rest
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set a password" icon="key">
        In **Authentication Method**, choose **Password**, then set a strong password.

        - If you already have a password configured, leaving the password field blank keeps the current password.
        - Use **Clear password** only if you intend to remove password protection.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Re-publish to apply changes" icon="upload">
        After saving your access control settings, re-publish your documentation so the deployed site uses the updated configuration.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Distribute access" icon="users">
        Securely share the docs URL and password with authorized users.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host documentation at `docs.example.com` and want basic access control without managing individual user accounts. Use **Password** authentication and share the password with authorized teammates.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT" icon="key-round">
    <Callout kind="warning">
      JWT authentication is available on Enterprise plans or higher.
    </Callout>

    Authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This method allows you to integrate your documentation with your existing authentication system and supports user-level personalization.

    ### Prerequisites

    - An Enterprise plan or higher
    - An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs
    - A backend service that can create redirect URLs back to your docs

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure JWT settings in the dashboard" icon="settings">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Access Control** and select **Private** or **Partial** mode.

        In **Authentication Method**, choose **JWT**, then configure your login URL (your existing login flow).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate a signing key" icon="key">
        Generate a key in the dashboard and store it securely where your backend can access it.

        Rotate keys using your established security process (for example, during incident response or scheduled rotation).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate the docs callback into your login flow" icon="arrow-right">
        After a user successfully authenticates in your system:

        - Create a JWT for that user (per the format required by Documentation.AI).
        - Sign the JWT using the algorithm required by Documentation.AI.
        - Redirect the user back to your docs site using the callback URL shown in the dashboard, including the signed JWT (the dashboard will show the exact callback format).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Preserve the user's intended destination (recommended)" icon="map">
        When an unauthenticated user tries to visit a protected page, preserve their target path through your login flow using a `redirect` query parameter, then redirect back to the docs callback URL with the same `redirect`.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host docs at `docs.example.com` and your company login is `https://login.example.com`. Configure **JWT** authentication so users sign in with your existing identity system, then return to the docs site.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0" icon="shield">
    <Callout kind="warning">
      OAuth 2.0 authentication is available on Enterprise plans or higher.
    </Callout>

    Authenticate users with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). This method integrates with popular identity providers and supports user-level personalization.

    ### Prerequisites

    - An Enterprise plan or higher
    - An OAuth 2.0 or OIDC provider that supports the Authorization Code flow

    ### Set up

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure OAuth in the dashboard" icon="settings">
        In your dashboard, go to **Settings → Access Control** and select **Private** or **Partial** mode.

        In **Authentication Method**, choose **OAuth 2.0**, then configure:

        - **Authorization URL**
        - **Token URL**
        - **Client ID**
        - **Client Secret**
        - **Scopes** (optional, if your provider requires them)
        - **User info URL** (optional, if your flow needs a separate user info fetch)
        - **Logout URL** (optional)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Register the redirect URL with your provider" icon="link">
        Copy the redirect/callback URL shown in the dashboard and add it to your OAuth provider's allowed redirect URLs.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Re-publish to apply changes" icon="upload">
        After saving your access control settings, re-publish your documentation so the deployed site uses the updated configuration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    You host docs at `docs.example.com` and use an existing OAuth provider for user sign-in. Configure **OAuth 2.0** authentication so visitors authenticate via your provider before accessing protected pages.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Partial access control

In **Partial** mode, Documentation.AI determines whether a page is **Public** or **Protected** using the `public` flag on navigation nodes. You can configure this using either the Web Editor or the Code Editor.

### Inheritance rules

- **Default**: If no `public` flag is set anywhere, pages are treated as **Protected** in partial mode.
- **Closest wins**: The closest (nearest) explicit `public` flag in the navigation tree determines the effective visibility for that node and its subtree.
- **Explicit override**: A child node can override its parent by setting its own `public` flag.

### Visibility values

- **Inherit**: Do not set `public` on the node (the effective value comes from the nearest parent that has `public`).
- **Public**: `public: true`
- **Protected**: `public: false`

## Configure public pages

You can make specific pages or groups public in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Editor" icon="browser">
    Use the Web Editor to visually configure which pages are public or protected.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the Web Editor" icon="browser">
        Navigate to your project dashboard and click on **Web Editor** to open the visual editor.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Navigate to the page or group" icon="folder">
        In the navigation panel, find the page or group you want to make public or protected.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure visibility" icon="eye">
        Select the page or group, then in the settings panel, set the visibility:
        
        - Choose **Public** to make it accessible without authentication
        - Choose **Protected** to require authentication
        - Choose **Inherit** to use the parent's setting
      </Step>

      <Step title="Publish changes" icon="upload">
        After configuring visibility for your pages, publish your documentation to apply the changes.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Callout kind="info">
      Changes made in the Web Editor are automatically synced to your `documentation.json` file.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Code Editor" icon="code">
    Configure the `public` property directly in your `documentation.json` file.

    ### Setting the public property

    The `public` property is an **optional boolean** that can be set on any navigation node (containers like groups/dropdowns/tabs/etc., and individual pages).

    ```json
    {
      "navigation": {
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Guides",
            "public": true,
            "pages": [
              {
                "title": "Overview",
                "path": "guides/overview"
              },
              {
                "title": "Internal Runbook",
                "path": "guides/internal-runbook",
                "public": false
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Semantics

    - **`public: true`**: Marks the node as public and makes its descendants public unless overridden.
    - **`public: false`**: Marks the node as protected and makes its descendants protected unless overridden.
    - **No `public` field**: The node inherits from its nearest parent that has `public`. If no parent has it, the default is protected in partial mode.
