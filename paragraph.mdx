# Paragraph Component

The Paragraph component is the fundamental building block for text content in DocumentationAI. It provides rich text formatting capabilities while maintaining semantic structure and accessibility.

## Overview

| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes for styling |

## Usage Examples

</Paragraph>
```
