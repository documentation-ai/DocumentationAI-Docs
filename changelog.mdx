<Update label="2025-12-04" description="AI Documentation Agent Launch (Beta)" tags={["feature","beta"]}>
  ## AI Documentation agent (beta)

  The AI Documentation agent is now available in beta for all workspaces. It helps you generate pages, apply rich visual components, and keep content aligned with your Documentation.AI configuration.

  **Where can you find it?**

  - Use the agent from the web editor (using "AI Agent" icon in the editor interface).

  **What can you do today?&#x20;**

  - Draft new documentation pages from scratch or from short briefs.

  - Make existing docs more visually appealing using rich components (Cards, Columns, Callouts, Tabs, Steps, and more).

  - Generate and refine code samples or usage snippets for your APIs and SDKs.

  - Use web search inside the agent to bring in up-to-date external information when needed.

  **Current limitations (beta)**

  - The agent is currently available only on the web. You can use coding agents like Cursor or GitHub Copilot if you are updating using an IDE. &#x20;

  - The agent understands Documentation.AI’s visual components and documentation structure, but does **not** yet take context from your codebases or support systems; these integrations are coming soon.

  - The agent cannot yet run in the background or autonomously; background workflows are coming soon.

  - All AI-generated content should be reviewed and edited before publishing
