title: Custom Subpath Setup Overview
description: "Deploy your documentation at a custom subpath like yoursite.com/docs using reverse proxy configuration."
---

## What is a Custom Subpath Deployment?

A custom subpath deployment allows you to host your documentation at a specific path on your domain, such as `yoursite.com/docs`, `yoursite.com/help`, `yoursite.com/documentation`, or any custom path you choose, rather than on a separate subdomain like `docs.yoursite.com`.

This approach integrates your documentation seamlessly into your main website while maintaining a unified domain structure.

<Callout kind="info">
  You have complete flexibility in choosing your subpath. Throughout this guide, we use <kbd>/docs</kbd> as an example, but you can replace it with any path like <kbd>/help</kbd>, <kbd>/guide</kbd>, <kbd>/api-docs</kbd>, <kbd>/support</kbd>, or <kbd>/documentation</kbd>.
</Callout>

## How It Works

Custom subpath deployments use a **reverse proxy** to route traffic:

1. **User visits** `yoursite.com/[SUBPATH]`
2. **Reverse proxy intercepts** the request
3. **Proxy forwards** the request to your documentation hosting
4. **Documentation responds** with the content
5. **Proxy returns** the response to the user
6. **Browser displays** content at `yoursite.com/[SUBPATH]`

<Callout kind="info">
  The reverse proxy acts as an intermediary, allowing you to serve documentation from a different hosting provider while maintaining your primary domain.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

**Marketing Sites with Docs**
Integrate documentation directly into your product marketing site without requiring users to navigate to a separate subdomain.

**Developer Portals**
Create unified developer experiences where API docs, guides, and product pages coexist under the same domain.

**Multi-Product Documentation**
Use different subpaths for different products: `yoursite.com/product-a/docs` and `yoursite.com/product-b/docs`.

**Enterprise Requirements**
Meet corporate policies that require all public-facing content on the primary domain.

## Architecture Overview

graph LR
    A[User Browser] -->|yoursite.com/subpath| B[Reverse Proxy]

    C -->|Returns Content| B

````

The reverse proxy:
- Routes `/[SUBPATH]/*` traffic to your documentation hosting
- Routes all other traffic to your main website
- Handles SSL termination
- Forwards necessary headers for domain verification

## Deployment Options Comparison

| Provider | Setup Complexity | Performance | Cost | Best For |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Vercel** | Low | Excellent | Free tier available | Next.js sites, fast setup |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Medium | Excellent | Free tier generous | Global distribution, flexibility |
| **AWS CloudFront** | High | Excellent | Pay as you go | Enterprise, AWS ecosystem |

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a custom subpath deployment, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Documentation Hosted">
    Your documentation must be deployed and accessible at `[SUBDOMAIN].documentationai.io`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain Access">
    Administrative access to your domain's DNS settings and hosting configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SSL Certificate">
    A valid SSL certificate for your domain (most providers offer free SSL).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reverse Proxy Platform">
    An account with Vercel, Cloudflare, AWS, or another reverse proxy service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Considerations

<Callout kind="alert">
  **Domain Verification Required**: When using a custom subpath, you must configure your reverse proxy to allow traffic to <kbd>/.well-known/\*</kbd> paths. These paths are required for SSL certificate verification and domain ownership validation.
</Callout>

### Required Path Allowlist

Your reverse proxy configuration must allow these paths to pass through without modification:

- `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt SSL certificate verification
- `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for domain verification (if using Vercel)

### Header Forwarding

Ensure your reverse proxy forwards the following headers:

```
Host: [SUBDOMAIN].documentationai.io
X-Forwarded-Host: yoursite.com
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
```

## Next Steps

Choose your deployment platform and follow the corresponding guide:

1. Review the platform-specific guide
2. Configure your reverse proxy
3. Update DNS settings
4. Test your deployment
5. Monitor for proper routing

<Callout kind="tip">
  Start with a staging environment to test your configuration before applying it to production.
