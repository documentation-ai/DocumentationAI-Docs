title: Custom Domain Setup
description: >-
  Connect your own domain to your documentation site for a professional, branded
  experience.
---
## Overview

A custom domain allows you to serve your documentation from your own domain (for example, docs.yourcompany.com) instead of the default Documentation.AI subdomain. This creates a seamless, branded experience for your users.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Custom domains require DNS configuration with your domain provider. The setup process typically takes a few minutes, but DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a custom domain, ensure you have:

A domain you own with access to DNS settings

Administrative access to your DNS provider (for example, Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, Route 53)

## Add your custom domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domain Settings" title-type="p">
    1. Log in to your [Documentation.AI dashboard](https://dashboard.documentationai.ai)

    2. Select your project

    3. Go to **Settings → Domain Settings**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your domain" title-type="p">
    In the **Custom Domains** section, enter your domain in the input field (for example, docs.yourcompany.com).

    Click the **Add** button to register your domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS records" title-type="p">
    After adding your domain, Documentation.AI will display the exact DNS records you need to add to your DNS provider. Depending on your configuration, you may see a combination of A or CNAME, and TXT records. All records shown in the dashboard must be added.

    A common configuration includes a CNAME record such as:

    | Type  | Name | Value                            |
    | ----- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
    | CNAME | docs | your-project.documentationai.com |

    Additional A or TXT records may appear for routing or verification and should be entered exactly as shown in your dashboard.

    <Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
      Always rely on the specific records displayed in your Documentation.AI dashboard. They reflect the correct values for your project.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add DNS records to your provider" title-type="p">
    Log in to your DNS provider and add the records shown in your Documentation.AI dashboard.

    **Common DNS providers:**

    - **Cloudflare**: DNS → Records → Add record

    - **GoDaddy**: DNS Management → Add → CNAME

    - **Namecheap**: Advanced DNS → Add New Record

    - **Route 53**: Hosted zones → Create a record

    - **Google Domains**: DNS → Custom records → Manage custom records
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Disable proxy mode

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  If you are using Cloudflare or another DNS provider with proxy capabilities, you must disable the proxy (orange cloud) for your documentation domain record.
</Callout>

When proxy mode is enabled, requests are routed through the provider's servers, which can interfere with SSL certificate generation and domain verification.

**To disable proxy in Cloudflare:**

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard

2. Select your domain

3. Navigate to **DNS → Records**

4. Find the CNAME record for your documentation subdomain

5. Click the orange cloud icon to toggle it to grey (DNS only)

6. Save your changes

The record should show **DNS only** status, not **Proxied**.

## Verify domain connection

After configuring your DNS records:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for DNS propagation" title-type="p">
    DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to propagate globally. Most changes propagate within 1–2 hours.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check verification status" title-type="p">
    Return to **Settings → Domain Settings** in your Documentation.AI dashboard.

    Click the **Refresh** button to check the current verification status of your domain.

    <Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
      If verification fails, wait a few more hours and try again. DNS propagation times vary by provider and region.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm SSL certificate" title-type="p">
    Once verified, Documentation.AI automatically provisions an SSL certificate for your domain. This ensures your documentation is served securely over HTTPS.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Re-publish your documentation

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  After your custom domain is verified and connected, you must re-publish your documentation for the changes to take effect.
</Callout>

Re-publish using one of these methods:

**From the Web Editor:**

1. Open your project in the web editor

2. Click **Publish** in the top navigation

3. Confirm the publish action

**From the Overview page:**

1. Go to your project dashboard

2. Click the **Publish** button

3. Wait for the deployment to complete

Your documentation will now be accessible at your custom domain.

## Troubleshooting

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Domain verification is taking too long" default-open="false">
    DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours in some cases. If verification has not completed after 24 hours:

    - Double-check that the DNS records match exactly what Documentation.AI provided

    - Ensure proxy mode is disabled (if using Cloudflare)

    - Verify there are no conflicting DNS records for the same subdomain

    - Use a DNS lookup tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your records are propagating
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="SSL certificate not generating" default-open="false">
    SSL certificates are automatically provisioned after domain verification. If the certificate is not generating:

    - Ensure the domain is fully verified first

    - Check that proxy mode is disabled on your DNS provider

    - Wait up to 1 hour after verification for certificate provisioning

    - Contact support if the issue persists after 24 hours
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Documentation not loading on custom domain" default-open="false">
    If your domain is verified but documentation is not loading:

    - Ensure you have re-published your documentation after connecting the domain

    - Clear your browser cache and try again

    - Check that you are using HTTPS (not HTTP)

    - Verify there are no firewall rules blocking the connection
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Conflicting DNS records" default-open="false">
    If you have existing DNS records for the same subdomain:

    - Remove any conflicting A, AAAA, or CNAME records for the subdomain

    - Only keep the CNAME record pointing to Documentation.AI

    - Wait for DNS propagation after making changes
