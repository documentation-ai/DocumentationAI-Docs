description: Understand views (tabs and dropdowns), how they relate to dimensions and content, and how to choose navigation patterns in Documentation.AI.

## Overview

Views control how content is organized and navigated *within a dimension context* in Documentation.AI.

- **Dimensions** decide *which* content is in scope (for example, product, audience, or version).
- **Views** decide *how* that scoped content appears in the UI (tabs, sidebar dropdowns, and their nesting).
- **Content nodes** (groups and pages) are placed inside views to form your actual navigation tree.

You work with views in two places:

- In the **Web Editor**, when you organize navigation for a project (see [Organize in the Web Editor](/write-and-publish/web-editor/organize)).
- In **site configuration**, when you define views and patterns programmatically (see [Site Configuration](/customize/site-configuration)).

This page focuses on the conceptual model and reference rules for views so you can design consistent navigation patterns across dimensions and projects.

Think of a **dimension** as a filter on content, and a **view** as the layout for navigating that filtered content.

## Supported view types

Documentation.AI supports two view types at the layout layer:

- **Tabs**: horizontal, top-level navigation areas.
- **Dropdowns**: collapsible sidebar categories.

Both types act as **containers** for content or other containers.

### Tabs

Tabs appear as a horizontal navigation bar, usually at the top of the content area, and let users switch between parallel sections like **Guides**, **API Reference**, or **Tutorials**.

Typical use cases:

- Separating **content modes** or **audience views** within the same dimension.
- Splitting large documentation sets into a small number of recognizable sections.
- Providing quick lateral navigation between sections that share a sidebar structure pattern.

Characteristics:

- A tab is usually a **top-level view** within a dimension.
- Each tab has its own **root container** for children (groups, dropdowns, or pages).
- Switching tabs re-roots the sidebar or section navigation for that dimension.

You will often see tabs used in patterns like:

- `Guides | API Reference`
- `Developers | Admins`
- `Product A | Product B` within a shared documentation project.

### Dropdowns

Dropdowns are collapsible items in the sidebar that group related navigation items under a labeled section.

Typical use cases:

- Structuring long sidebars into logical **categories** like **Getting Started**, **Integrations**, **SDKs**, or **Admin**.
- Implementing multi-level **hierarchical categorization** inside a tab or another dropdown.
- Organizing API reference by resource or functional area (for example, **Users**, **Billing**, **Webhooks**).

Characteristics:

- A dropdown is a **container**: it does not directly render content; it reveals its child nodes.
- Dropdowns can appear directly under a tab or nested under another dropdown.
- They are suited for **hierarchical** navigation where users drill down.

In practice, your main sidebar will often be composed of dropdowns with groups and pages inside.

## View nesting patterns and the one-child rule

Views follow predictable nesting patterns so navigation stays consistent and the editor UI can prevent invalid structures.

### Supported view nesting patterns

The standard UI templates support these patterns between tabs and dropdowns:

| Pattern       | Structure                    | Typical use case                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pattern 1** | `Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown` | Complex, category-first navigation with sub-sections  |
| **Pattern 2** | `Dropdown → Dropdown`        | Pure hierarchical sidebar without horizontal tabs     |
| **Pattern 3** | `Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown` | Tabbed sections each with their own nested categories |

In each pattern:

- **Tabs** and **dropdowns** act as the layout containers.
- **Groups** and **pages** are the leaf-level content or light-weight containers under those views.

### The one-child rule

Every container in the navigation tree can contain **exactly one child type**.

This rule applies both in the Web Editor and in `documentation.json` site configuration:

- A **tab** can contain **only one** of:
  - pages, *or*
  - groups, *or*
  - dropdowns
- A **dropdown** can contain **only one** of:
  - pages, *or*
  - groups, *or*
  - tabs, *or*
  - dropdowns

You cannot mix child types under the same container (for example, a dropdown cannot directly hold both pages *and* other dropdowns).

<Callout kind="tip">

If the Editor does not show an option like "Add tab" or "Add dropdown" at a certain level, it is because the **one-child rule** would be violated by mixing child types.

</Callout>

This constraint ensures:

- Navigation is predictable and easier to scan.
- Configuration in the Web Editor and site configuration remains symmetrical.
- Large trees stay maintainable, because each level behaves consistently.

## How views relate to dimensions, groups, and pages

To design navigation that scales, it helps to keep the layering clear:

- **Dimension**
  - Defines a scope such as `Product`, `Version`, or `Audience`.
  - Within each dimension context, you define **views**.
- **Views (tabs, dropdowns)**
  - Control layout and interaction patterns inside that dimension.
  - Determine whether users first choose between top-level sections (tabs) or drill down categories (dropdowns).
- **Groups and pages**
  - Represent actual documentation content and sections.
  - Are placed beneath views according to the one-child rule.

A common pattern for a dimension might look like:

- Tabs: `Guides | API Reference`
  - Each tab has:
    - Sidebar dropdowns like `Getting Started`, `Tutorials`, `Integration Guides`.
    - Groups/pages inside each dropdown.

When designing across multiple dimensions, try to keep **view patterns consistent** so users do not have to relearn navigation for each context.

## Design guidelines and common patterns

### When to use tabs vs dropdowns

Use **tabs** when:

- You need clear, top-level separation between **modes**, **audiences**, or **content types**.
- You have 2–5 major sections that users should be able to switch between quickly.
- You want the sidebar structure to reset depending on the active section.

Use **dropdowns** when:

- You are organizing related content within a single section or tab.
- The sidebar is long enough that scannability becomes an issue.
- You need 2–3 levels of hierarchy for complex topics (for example, deep API reference structures).

If you are unsure, default to:

- A small number of **tabs** at the top level.
- **Dropdowns** in the sidebar under each tab to group content.

### Choosing a nesting pattern

Use these heuristic patterns:

- **Pattern 3: `Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown`**  
  Good default for most medium-to-large documentation sets:
  - Tabs separate high-level sections.
  - The first level of dropdowns groups major categories.
  - A second dropdown level is available for large categories (for example, many APIs).

- **Pattern 2: `Dropdown → Dropdown`**  
  Use when:
  - Your project is small or focused enough that tabs are not necessary.
  - You want a single continuous sidebar with hierarchical categories.

- **Pattern 1: `Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown`**  
  Use when:
  - Users first choose a **high-level area** in the sidebar (like "Product A vs Product B").
  - Inside that area, they need multiple parallel sections exposed as tabs.
  - Each tab then has its own dropdown-based sidebar.

### Consistency and maintenance tips

- **Align across dimensions**  
  If you have a `Version` dimension, for example, keep the **tab labels and dropdown structure** consistent across versions to reduce cognitive load.

- **Minimize depth**  
  Even though dropdowns can nest, prefer no more than **two dropdown levels** deep in most projects. Beyond that, content is often better split into an additional tab or dimension.

- **Name views by user intent**  
  Use labels that match how readers think:
  - Prefer `Getting Started` over `Onboarding Docs`.
  - Prefer `API Reference` over `Backend`.

- **Plan before implementing**  
  Sketch your dimension, view, and content hierarchy before editing navigation:
  - What dimensions exist?
  - Which tabs are required in each dimension?
  - How will dropdowns group content inside each tab?
