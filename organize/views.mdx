  Understand views (tabs and dropdowns), how they relate to dimensions and
  content, and how to choose and manage navigation patterns in the Web Editor.
---
## Overview

Views control how content is organized and navigated **within a Dimension context** in Documentation.AI.

- **Dimensions** decide *which* content is in scope (for example, product, audience, or version).

- **Views** decide *how* that scoped content appears in the UI (Tabs, Sidebar Dropdowns, and how they nest).

- **Content items** (Groups, Pages, Page Groups, OpenAPI References) live **inside** Views to form your navigation tree.

You work with views in two places:

- In the **Web Editor**, when you organize navigation for a project.

- In **site configuration**, when you define views and patterns programmatically (see [Site configuration](/customize/site-configuration)).

This page focuses on:

- The conceptual model and reference rules for views.

- A **Web Editor–focused workflow** for adding and organizing tabs and dropdowns.

  Think of a **dimension** as a filter on content, and a **view** as the layout for navigating that filtered content.
</Callout>

## Supported view types

Documentation.AI supports two view types at the layout layer:

- **Tabs**: horizontal, top-level navigation areas.

- **Dropdowns**: collapsible sidebar categories.

Both types act as **containers** for content or other containers.

### Tabs

Tabs are top-level navigation sections such as **Guides**, **API Reference**, or **Changelog**.

**Use Tabs when:**

- You have **2–5 major sections** readers switch between often.

- Each section needs its **own navigation branch**.

- You want clear separation between content types (Guides vs API) or audiences (Developers vs Admins).

**What Tabs do:&#x20;**&#x53;witching Tabs changes the active navigation branch and typically changes what appears in the sidebar.

You will often see tabs used in patterns like:

- `Guides | API Reference | Changelog`

- `Developers | Admins`

### Dropdowns

Dropdowns are collapsible sidebar categories such as **Getting Started**, **Integrations**, or **SDKs**.

Use Dropdowns when:

- The sidebar is long and needs **clear categories**.

- You need **hierarchy** inside a section.

- You want readers to drill down through categories.

What Dropdowns do:

- A Dropdown is a container: it reveals child items when expanded.

- Dropdowns can nest, but keep nesting shallow in most docs.

In practice, your main sidebar will often be composed of dropdowns with groups and pages inside.

## Core rules for Views

These rules explain how Views work and why the Web Editor shows (or hides) certain actions.

### 1) Views never contain Dimensions

Dimensions (when used) are always the **outermost** layer of the navigation tree.

- You **can** add a View as a parent for another **View** or for **Content**.

- You **cannot** add a View as a parent for **Dimensions**.

If you need Product/Version/Language selectors, add a **Dimension layer** first. Then add Views inside each dimension branch.

### 2) The one-child rule

Every container can contain **exactly one child type**.

- A **Tab** can contain only one of: **Pages**, **Groups**, or **Dropdowns**.

- A **Dropdown** can contain only one of: **Pages**, **Groups**, **Tabs**, or **Dropdowns**.

You cannot mix child types at the same level (for example, a dropdown cannot contain both Pages and Dropdowns as siblings).

This is why the Web Editor hides “Add …” options at certain levels—it only shows actions that keep the tree valid.

### 3) Common supported nesting patterns

- Tabs → Dropdowns → Dropdowns

- Dropdowns → Dropdowns

- Dropdowns → Tabs → Dropdowns

Keep structures shallow (typically no more than two dropdown levels) unless you have a strong reason.

## Two starting states: with Dimensions vs without Dimensions

Your project can be organized in either of these ways:

- **With Dimensions**: you first select a Dimension value (for example, Version: v1.0), then build Views inside it.

- **Without Dimensions**: there is only one global navigation tree, and you build Views directly at the root.

The Editor supports both. The steps for adding Views change slightly depending on which starting state you’re in.

## Working with Views in the Web Editor

Before you start: choose the correct branch

- Open **Editor → Navigation**.

- If you see **Product/Version/Language** selectors, your project **has Dimensions**. If you don’t, you’re editing a **single global navigation tree** (no Dimensions).

- Confirm you’re editing the right branch by switching the available selectors and verifying the navigation tree changes as expected.

### How layering works (Parent vs Child)

- **Add Parent layer (top “**<kbd>+</kbd>**”)**: wraps the current level in a new container and moves existing items under it. Use when you want to restructure **everything at that level**.

- **Add Child layer (bottom/inline “**<kbd>+</kbd>**”)**: adds a new container only inside the selected item. Use when you want to restructure **only that section**.

- Layers can wrap **Views or Content**, but **Views can’t be added above Dimensions**.

### Scenario 1: Add Views when your project has Dimensions

**1) Select the correct Dimension branch:**

- Open the **Editor** and go to the **Navigation** panel.

- Select the Dimension value you want to edit (for example, **Version: v1.0**).

- Confirm you’re in the right branch by switching Dimension values and verifying the sidebar content changes.

You always add Views *inside* the selected Dimension branch.

**2) Add Tabs or Dropdowns using layers:**

- Use **Add Parent layer** (top-level <kbd>+</kbd>) when you want to wrap the current level and introduce a new container above it (for example, adding another view above existing tabs).

- Use **Add Child layer** (bottom <kbd>+</kbd>) when you only want to add structure *inside* the selected item (for example, a new tab inside a version).

  <Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-53a37986-2c9e-4094-b9e8-1e1ffae9e9ee/doc-b389b141-ae58-4fd5-91f9-6702fae9ac58/1767103748004-qgrro8hldwm-pasted-image-1767103745006.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="410" height="274" alt="Adding a child layer 'view'" caption="Adding a child layer 'view'" style="width: 410px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0 auto 0 0;" />

Then choose either **Add Tabs** or **Add Dropdowns**.

**3) Name and add sibling Views**

- Name the first tab/dropdown item clearly.

- The Editor moves your existing content under the new View layer automatically.

- Add more sibling tabs/dropdowns at the same level (for example, add “API Reference” after “Guides”).

**4) Confirm placement**

- Switch between tabs/dropdowns and confirm you see the expected content under each.

- If content moved unexpectedly, you likely used **Parent** where you intended **Child** (or vice versa).

### Scenario 2: Add Views when your project has no Dimensions

When there are no Dimensions, you are editing a single global navigation tree. Views are added directly at the root (or inside any existing View).

1. **&#x20;Start at the root navigation**

   1. Open the **Editor** and go to the **Navigation** panel.

   2. If you do not see any Dimension selectors, your project is using **no Dimensions**.

   3. The structure you see is the root navigation tree for the entire site.

2. **Introduce Views at the root (recommended)&#x20;**\
   This is the safest way to add structure after you already have pages.

   1. Use **Add Parent layer** at the root level:\
      Hover on the top area above the **Groups/Pages** Section heading and click **Add Parent layer (top&#x20;**<kbd>+</kbd>**)** to wrap the existing root content.

      <Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-53a37986-2c9e-4094-b9e8-1e1ffae9e9ee/doc-b389b141-ae58-4fd5-91f9-6702fae9ac58/1767107077506-wwndjicikn-pasted-image-1767107075459.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="486" height="247" alt="Adding 'view' in flat document structure" caption="Adding 'view' in flat document structure" />

   2. Choose **Add Tabs** or **Add Dropdowns** to add Views.

   3. Enter the first tab or dropdown name and create sibling items.

3. **Validate:&#x20;**&#x53;witch between newly created tabs/dropdowns and confirm content is split as intended.

### Adding Views inside existing Views (nested Views)

Once a View exists, you can add another View underneath it, as long as the one-child rule is respected.

Common examples:

- Add **Dropdowns under a Tab** to create sidebar categories.

- Nest **Dropdowns inside a Dropdown** for sub-categories.

- Add **Tabs inside a Dropdown** only if your intended pattern supports it (Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown).

If an “Add Tabs” or “Add Dropdowns” option is missing:

- It usually means adding it there would violate the one-child rule.

- Fix by wrapping content using **Add Parent layer**, or by moving items into a container that already uses the child type you need.

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-53a37986-2c9e-4094-b9e8-1e1ffae9e9ee/doc-b389b141-ae58-4fd5-91f9-6702fae9ac58/1767107208674-dzefm92fgxu-pasted-image-1767107206487.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="392" height="252" alt="Adding a 'view' inside a View (Tabs)" caption="Adding a 'view' inside a View (Tabs)" style="width: 392px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0 auto;" />

### How Views connect to Groups and Pages in the sidebar

After you select a branch (for example: Version: v1.0 → Tab: Guides → Dropdown: Integrations), the sidebar will show the content level for that branch:

- If that branch uses Groups, you’ll see a **Groups** section and add pages inside a group.

- If that branch is flat, you’ll see a **Pages** section and add pages at the top level.

Views determine where you are in the navigation tree. Groups/Pages determine what content exists inside that branch.

## View nesting patterns and the one-child rule

Views follow predictable nesting patterns so navigation stays consistent and the editor UI can prevent invalid structures.

### Supported view nesting patterns

The standard UI templates support these patterns between tabs and dropdowns:

| Pattern       | Structure                    | Typical use case                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pattern 1** | `Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown` | Complex, category-first navigation with sub-sections  |
| **Pattern 2** | `Dropdown → Dropdown`        | Pure hierarchical sidebar without horizontal tabs     |
| **Pattern 3** | `Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown` | Tabbed sections each with their own nested categories |

In each pattern:

- **Tabs** and **dropdowns** act as the layout containers.

- **Groups** and **pages** are the leaf-level content or light-weight containers under those views.

### The one-child rule

Every container in the navigation tree can contain **exactly one child type**.

This rule applies both in the Web Editor and in `documentation.json` site configuration:

- A **tab** can contain **only one** of:

  - pages, *or*

  - groups, *or*

  - dropdowns

- A **dropdown** can contain **only one** of:

  - pages, *or*

  - groups, *or*

  - tabs, *or*

  - dropdowns

You cannot mix child types under the same container (for example, a dropdown cannot directly hold both pages *and* other dropdowns).

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  If the Editor does not show an option like `Add tab` or `Add dropdown` at a certain level, it is because the **one-child rule** would be violated by mixing child types.
</Callout>

This constraint ensures:

- Navigation is predictable and easier to scan.

- Configuration in the Web Editor and site configuration remains symmetrical.

- Large trees stay maintainable, because each level behaves consistently.

## How views relate to dimensions, groups, and pages

To design navigation that scales, it helps to keep the layering clear:

- **Dimension**

  - Defines a scope such as `Product`, `Version`, or `Audience`.

  - Within each dimension context, you define **views**.

- **Views (tabs, dropdowns)**

  - Control layout and interaction patterns inside that dimension.

  - Determine whether users first choose between top-level sections (tabs) or drill down categories (dropdowns).

- **Groups and pages**

  - Represent actual documentation content and sections.

  - Are placed beneath views according to the one-child rule.

A common pattern for a dimension might look like:

- Tabs: `Guides | API Reference`

  - Each tab has:

    - Sidebar dropdowns like `Getting Started`, `Tutorials`, `Integration Guides`.

    - Groups/pages inside each dropdown.

When designing across multiple dimensions, try to keep **view patterns consistent** so users do not have to relearn navigation for each context.

## Manage views in the Web Editor

This section focuses on how to apply the concepts above inside the Web Editor navigation panel.

### Prerequisites

Before you change views:

- You have a **project** open in the Web Editor.

- You understand the basics of:

  - **Dimensions** as context selectors (see [Dimensions](/organize/dimensions)).

  - **Views** as tabs and dropdowns inside a dimension.

  - The **one-child rule** for containers.

### Understand the navigation panel

In the Web Editor, the left side shows:

- **Dimension selectors** at the top.\
  These filters set the active context, such as a specific product or version. Changing them does not change your content; it changes *which slice* of content and views you are editing.

- The **navigation tree** below.\
  This shows tabs, dropdowns, groups, pages, and other content types *for the current dimension context*.

- **Add controls** on each row and header:

  - A **top or side \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`+`** usually corresponds to **Add Parent layer**.

  - A **bottom or inline \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`+`** usually corresponds to **Add Child layer**.

Exactly labels and icons can vary, but the distinction is:

- **Parent layer**: wraps existing items in a new container.

- **Child layer**: adds new items inside the selected container.

### Add tabs and dropdowns with layering

You can add views either at the top level (for example, to introduce tabs) or inside existing containers (for example, to add dropdowns under a tab).

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Use **Add Parent layer** when you want to change structure for everything at a level. Use **Add Child layer** when you want to add structure only within one section.
</Callout>

#### Add tabs above existing content

Use this when you already have a single long sidebar and now want to split it into sections like `Guides` and `API Reference`.

1. **Select your dimension context**\
   At the top of the navigation panel, choose the dimension values you want to configure (for example, `Product = Core`, `Version = v1`).

2. **Identify the current root container**\
   Look at the top level of the navigation tree. It might currently be a series of dropdowns or groups.

3. **Use Add Parent layer at the root**\
   Click the **Add Parent** control (top-level `+`) to wrap the existing items in a new container.

4. **Choose Tabs as the new parent type**\
   When prompted, select **Tabs** for the new layer. The existing root items will move inside the first tab.

5. **Rename and duplicate tabs**

   - Rename the first tab to something meaningful (for example, `Guides`).

   - Add more tabs as needed at the same level (for example, `API Reference`, `Tutorials`, `Changelog`).

6. **Move or rearrange content between tabs**\
   Within each tab, drag and drop dropdowns or groups so that each tab has the right subset of content.

Because of the one-child rule, once a tab is configured to contain dropdowns, all children must be dropdowns (not a mix of groups and pages). Adjust structure as needed by adding groups or dropdowns and moving pages under them.

#### Add dropdowns within a tab or container

Use this when you want sidebar categories inside a tab or dropdown.

1. **Select the target container**\
   Click the tab or dropdown where you want to add categories.

2. **Use Add Child layer**\
   Inside that container, use the bottom or inline `+` control to **Add Child**.

3. **Choose Dropdowns as the child type**\
   When you add the first child under this container, choose **Dropdowns** if you plan to have multiple categories.

4. **Create and name dropdowns**\
   Add dropdowns for each major category, for example:

   - `Getting Started`

   - `Guides`

   - `SDKs`

   - `Admin`

5. **Place content inside dropdowns**\
   Within each dropdown, use **Add Child** again to choose the actual content type:

   - **Groups** or **Pages** for regular documentation.

   - **Page groups** for structured sections.

   - **OpenAPI reference** entries for imported API specs.

   - **Unpublished page** when drafting content that is not yet visible.

Once you choose a child type (for example, groups), that dropdown can only contain that same type until you refactor the structure.

### Use layers to refactor safely

When your structure evolves, you will often need to insert new levels without rebuilding everything.

Common refactors:

- **Insert a dropdown layer between a tab and its pages**

  - If a tab currently has many pages directly under it, use **Add Parent** on the set of pages to wrap them in a new dropdown (`Getting Started`).

  - Then use **Add Child** inside that dropdown to add additional groups or pages.

- **Split a large dropdown into sub-categories**

  - Use **Add Parent** on a subset of items inside the dropdown to create a nested dropdown.

  - Move related pages or groups into the new nested dropdown.

When you use the Parent vs Child distinction consistently:

- You avoid breaking slugs or moving content unnecessarily.

- You can keep navigation shallow while still grouping related content clearly.

### Validate your structure by switching selectors

After you add or change views, validate how navigation behaves:

1. **Switch between tabs**\
   Confirm that:

   - Each tab label is clear.

   - The sidebar content changes appropriately when you switch tabs.

   - Dropdown categories under each tab are consistent and not duplicated unnecessarily.

2. **Switch dimension selectors**\
   For dimensions like `Version` or `Product`, change the selector values and check:

   - Whether the **tab labels** remain consistent across values where it makes sense.

   - Whether each dimension value has the required views (for example, both `v1` and `v2` have `Guides` and `API Reference` tabs).

3. **Follow a user journey**\
   Navigate as a reader would:

   - Start from a dimension context.

   - Click a tab.

   - Expand dropdowns to find key pages (for example, a quickstart or API reference endpoint).
     If any step feels surprising or hard to find, adjust labels or groupings rather than adding more nesting.

## Step-by-step: create a standard views structure

Use this procedure to set up a common pattern: `Tabs → Dropdown → Pages/Groups` in a single project and dimension.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the dimension context" icon="layers" title-type="p">
    - Open your project in the Web Editor.

    - At the top of the navigation panel, choose the dimension values you want to configure (for example, your main product and default version).

    - Confirm you are editing the correct context before changing views.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add top-level tabs" icon="lucide-panel-top" title-type="p">
    - Look at the top of the navigation tree.

    - If you already see tabs and they match your plan (for example, `Guides`, `API Reference`), you can skip this step.

    - If you do not see tabs:

      - Use the **Add Parent** control at the root level.

      - Choose **Tabs** as the new parent type.

      - Rename the first tab and add additional tabs (for example, `Guides`, `API Reference`, `Tutorials`, `Changelog`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create dropdowns inside each tab" icon="folder" title-type="p">
    - Select a tab (for example, `Guides`) in the navigation tree.

    - Use the **Add Child** control inside the tab.

    - When choosing the child type for the first time under this tab, select **Dropdowns**.

    - Create dropdowns such as:

      - `Getting Started`

      - `How-to guides`

      - `Concepts`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Place content under dropdowns" icon="file-text" title-type="p">
    - For each dropdown (for example, `Getting Started`), select it in the navigation tree.

    - Use **Add Child** to choose the content type:

      - **Groups** if you want another lightweight structure level.

      - **Pages** when you are ready to place individual docs.

      - **OpenAPI reference** if this area is API-centric.

    - Add or move existing pages/groups into the appropriate dropdowns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respect the one-child rule while you adjust" icon="alert-triangle" title-type="p">
    - At each container (tab or dropdown), choose and stick to a single child type:

      - If a tab currently contains dropdowns, all children should be dropdowns.

      - If a dropdown contains pages, do not mix groups at the same level.

    - If an `Add ...` option is missing in the UI, assume the one-child rule is blocking that combination and consider:

      - Wrapping items with **Add Parent** to introduce a new container type.

      - Moving items into another container that uses the desired child type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate by switching tabs and dimensions" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    - Switch between your new tabs and check that each:

      - Has clear dropdown labels.

      - Shows only the content that belongs in that section.

    - Change dimension selectors (for example, different versions) and repeat:

      - Confirm consistent view patterns across related values.

      - Fix any missing or mismatched tabs or dropdowns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Design guidelines and common patterns

### When to use tabs vs dropdowns

Use **tabs** when:

- You need clear, top-level separation between **modes**, **audiences**, or **content types**.

- You have 2–5 major sections that users should be able to switch between quickly.

- You want the sidebar structure to reset depending on the active section.

Use **dropdowns** when:

- You are organizing related content within a single section or tab.

- The sidebar is long enough that scannability becomes an issue.

- You need 2–3 levels of hierarchy for complex topics (for example, deep API reference structures).

If you are unsure, default to:

- A small number of **tabs** at the top level.

- **Dropdowns** in the sidebar under each tab to group content.

### Choosing a nesting pattern

Use these heuristic patterns:

- **Pattern 3: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown`**\
  Good default for most medium-to-large documentation sets:

  - Tabs separate high-level sections.

  - The first level of dropdowns groups major categories.

  - A second dropdown level is available for large categories (for example, many APIs).

- **Pattern 2: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`Dropdown → Dropdown`**\
  Use when:

  - Your project is small or focused enough that tabs are not necessary.

  - You want a single continuous sidebar with hierarchical categories.

- **Pattern 1: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown`**\
  Use when:

  - Users first choose a **high-level area** in the sidebar (like `Product A` vs `Product B`).

  - Inside that area, they need multiple parallel sections exposed as tabs.

  - Each tab then has its own dropdown-based sidebar.

### Consistency and maintenance tips

- **Align across dimensions**\
  If you have a `Version` dimension, for example, keep the **tab labels and dropdown structure** consistent across versions to reduce cognitive load.

- **Minimize depth**\
  Even though dropdowns can nest, prefer no more than **two dropdown levels** deep in most projects. Beyond that, content is often better split into an additional tab or dimension.

- **Name views by user intent**\
  Use labels that match how readers think:

  - Prefer `Getting Started` over `Onboarding Docs`.

  - Prefer `API Reference` over `Backend`.

- **Plan before implementing**\
  Sketch your dimension, view, and content hierarchy before editing navigation:

  - What dimensions exist?

  - Which tabs are required in each dimension?

  - How will dropdowns group content inside each tab?

For concrete field names and configuration examples, see:

- [Dimensions](/organize/dimensions) for how dimension selectors define context.

- [Groups](/organize/groups) and [Pages](/organize/pages) for what lives under views.

- [Site configuration](/customize/site-configuration) for JSON configuration patterns of views, tabs, and dropdowns.
