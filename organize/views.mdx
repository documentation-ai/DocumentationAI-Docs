  Understand views (tabs and dropdowns), how they relate to dimensions and
  content, and how to choose and manage navigation patterns in the Web Editor.

## Overview

Views control how content is organized and navigated *within a dimension context* in Documentation.AI.

- **Dimensions** decide *which* content is in scope (for example, product, audience, or version).

- **Views** decide *how* that scoped content appears in the UI (tabs, sidebar dropdowns, and their nesting).

- **Content nodes** (groups and pages) are placed inside views to form your actual navigation tree.

You work with views in two places:

- In the **Web Editor**, when you organize navigation for a project.

- In **site configuration**, when you define views and patterns programmatically (see [Site configuration](/customize/site-configuration)).

This page focuses on:

- The conceptual model and reference rules for views.

- A **Web Editor–focused workflow** for adding and organizing tabs and dropdowns.

  Think of a **dimension** as a filter on content, and a **view** as the layout for navigating that filtered content.
</Callout>

## Working with Views in the Web Editor

Use this high-level flow whenever you are setting up or restructuring navigation inside a project:

1. **Choose a dimension context**\
   In the Web Editor, set the active **dimension selectors** (for example, `Product`, `Audience`, `Version`) at the top of the navigation panel. This defines *which* content you are organizing.

2. **Plan your view pattern**\
   Decide whether you need **tabs**, **dropdowns**, or both for this dimension:

   - Tabs for major sections (for example, `Guides`, `API Reference`, `Tutorials`, `Changelog`).

   - Dropdowns for sidebar categories (for example, `Getting Started`, `SDKs`, `Admin`).

3. **Use layers to change structure safely**

   - Use **Add Parent layer** (top-level `+`) when you want to wrap the current level and introduce a new container above it (for example, adding tabs above existing dropdowns).

   - Use **Add Child layer** (bottom `+` or inline `+`) when you only want to add structure *inside* the selected item (for example, a new dropdown inside a tab).

4. **Respect the one-child rule**\
   At each level, choose **one child type** (tabs, dropdowns, groups, or pages). If an option is hidden in the Editor, the one-child rule is preventing an invalid mix.

5. **Add content under views**\
   Under each tab or dropdown, add content items:

   - **Group**, **Page**, **Page group**, **OpenAPI reference**, or **Unpublished page** (as allowed by the one-child rule).

6. **Validate by switching selectors**\
   Switch dimension selectors and tabs to confirm:

   - The labels make sense.

   - The sidebar reshapes as expected.

   - You see consistent patterns across related dimension values (for example, between versions).

The rest of this page explains the building blocks, then walks through a concrete step‑by‑step workflow in the Web Editor.

## Supported view types

Documentation.AI supports two view types at the layout layer:

- **Tabs**: horizontal, top-level navigation areas.

- **Dropdowns**: collapsible sidebar categories.

Both types act as **containers** for content or other containers.

### Tabs

Tabs appear as a horizontal navigation bar, usually at the top of the content area, and let users switch between parallel sections like **Guides**, **API Reference**, or **Tutorials**.

Typical use cases:

- Separating **content modes** or **audience views** within the same dimension.

- Splitting large documentation sets into a small number of recognizable sections.

- Providing quick lateral navigation between sections that share a sidebar structure pattern.

Characteristics:

- A tab is usually a **top-level view** within a dimension.

- Each tab has its own **root container** for children (groups, dropdowns, or pages).

- Switching tabs re-roots the sidebar or section navigation for that dimension.

You will often see tabs used in patterns like:

- `Guides | API Reference`

- `Developers | Admins`

- `Product A | Product B` within a shared documentation project.

### Dropdowns

Dropdowns are collapsible items in the sidebar that group related navigation items under a labeled section.

Typical use cases:

- Structuring long sidebars into logical **categories** like **Getting Started**, **Integrations**, **SDKs**, or **Admin**.

- Implementing multi-level **hierarchical categorization** inside a tab or another dropdown.

- Organizing API reference by resource or functional area (for example, **Users**, **Billing**, **Webhooks**).

Characteristics:

- A dropdown is a **container**: it does not directly render content; it reveals its child nodes.

- Dropdowns can appear directly under a tab or nested under another dropdown.

- They are suited for **hierarchical** navigation where users drill down.

In practice, your main sidebar will often be composed of dropdowns with groups and pages inside.

## View nesting patterns and the one-child rule

Views follow predictable nesting patterns so navigation stays consistent and the editor UI can prevent invalid structures.

### Supported view nesting patterns

The standard UI templates support these patterns between tabs and dropdowns:

| Pattern       | Structure                    | Typical use case                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pattern 1** | `Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown` | Complex, category-first navigation with sub-sections  |
| **Pattern 2** | `Dropdown → Dropdown`        | Pure hierarchical sidebar without horizontal tabs     |
| **Pattern 3** | `Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown` | Tabbed sections each with their own nested categories |

In each pattern:

- **Tabs** and **dropdowns** act as the layout containers.

- **Groups** and **pages** are the leaf-level content or light-weight containers under those views.

### The one-child rule

Every container in the navigation tree can contain **exactly one child type**.

This rule applies both in the Web Editor and in `documentation.json` site configuration:

- A **tab** can contain **only one** of:

  - pages, *or*

  - groups, *or*

  - dropdowns

- A **dropdown** can contain **only one** of:

  - pages, *or*

  - groups, *or*

  - tabs, *or*

  - dropdowns

You cannot mix child types under the same container (for example, a dropdown cannot directly hold both pages *and* other dropdowns).

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  If the Editor does not show an option like `Add tab` or `Add dropdown` at a certain level, it is because the **one-child rule** would be violated by mixing child types.
</Callout>

This constraint ensures:

- Navigation is predictable and easier to scan.

- Configuration in the Web Editor and site configuration remains symmetrical.

- Large trees stay maintainable, because each level behaves consistently.

## How views relate to dimensions, groups, and pages

To design navigation that scales, it helps to keep the layering clear:

- **Dimension**

  - Defines a scope such as `Product`, `Version`, or `Audience`.

  - Within each dimension context, you define **views**.

- **Views (tabs, dropdowns)**

  - Control layout and interaction patterns inside that dimension.

  - Determine whether users first choose between top-level sections (tabs) or drill down categories (dropdowns).

- **Groups and pages**

  - Represent actual documentation content and sections.

  - Are placed beneath views according to the one-child rule.

A common pattern for a dimension might look like:

- Tabs: `Guides | API Reference`

  - Each tab has:

    - Sidebar dropdowns like `Getting Started`, `Tutorials`, `Integration Guides`.

    - Groups/pages inside each dropdown.

When designing across multiple dimensions, try to keep **view patterns consistent** so users do not have to relearn navigation for each context.

## Manage views in the Web Editor

This section focuses on how to apply the concepts above inside the Web Editor navigation panel.

### Prerequisites

Before you change views:

- You have a **project** open in the Web Editor.

- You understand the basics of:

  - **Dimensions** as context selectors (see [Dimensions](/organize/dimensions)).

  - **Views** as tabs and dropdowns inside a dimension.

  - The **one-child rule** for containers.

### Understand the navigation panel

In the Web Editor, the left side shows:

- **Dimension selectors** at the top.\
  These filters set the active context, such as a specific product or version. Changing them does not change your content; it changes *which slice* of content and views you are editing.

- The **navigation tree** below.\
  This shows tabs, dropdowns, groups, pages, and other content types *for the current dimension context*.

- **Add controls** on each row and header:

  - A **top or side&#x20;****`+`** usually corresponds to **Add Parent layer**.

  - A **bottom or inline&#x20;****`+`** usually corresponds to **Add Child layer**.

Exactly labels and icons can vary, but the distinction is:

- **Parent layer**: wraps existing items in a new container.

- **Child layer**: adds new items inside the selected container.

### Add tabs and dropdowns with layering

You can add views either at the top level (for example, to introduce tabs) or inside existing containers (for example, to add dropdowns under a tab).

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Use **Add Parent layer** when you want to change structure for everything at a level. Use **Add Child layer** when you want to add structure only within one section.
</Callout>

#### Add tabs above existing content

Use this when you already have a single long sidebar and now want to split it into sections like `Guides` and `API Reference`.

1. **Select your dimension context**\
   At the top of the navigation panel, choose the dimension values you want to configure (for example, `Product = Core`, `Version = v1`).

2. **Identify the current root container**\
   Look at the top level of the navigation tree. It might currently be a series of dropdowns or groups.

3. **Use Add Parent layer at the root**\
   Click the **Add Parent** control (top-level `+`) to wrap the existing items in a new container.

4. **Choose Tabs as the new parent type**\
   When prompted, select **Tabs** for the new layer. The existing root items will move inside the first tab.

5. **Rename and duplicate tabs**

   - Rename the first tab to something meaningful (for example, `Guides`).

   - Add more tabs as needed at the same level (for example, `API Reference`, `Tutorials`, `Changelog`).

6. **Move or rearrange content between tabs**\
   Within each tab, drag and drop dropdowns or groups so that each tab has the right subset of content.

Because of the one-child rule, once a tab is configured to contain dropdowns, all children must be dropdowns (not a mix of groups and pages). Adjust structure as needed by adding groups or dropdowns and moving pages under them.

#### Add dropdowns within a tab or container

Use this when you want sidebar categories inside a tab or dropdown.

1. **Select the target container**\
   Click the tab or dropdown where you want to add categories.

2. **Use Add Child layer**\
   Inside that container, use the bottom or inline `+` control to **Add Child**.

3. **Choose Dropdowns as the child type**\
   When you add the first child under this container, choose **Dropdowns** if you plan to have multiple categories.

4. **Create and name dropdowns**\
   Add dropdowns for each major category, for example:

   - `Getting Started`

   - `Guides`

   - `SDKs`

   - `Admin`

5. **Place content inside dropdowns**\
   Within each dropdown, use **Add Child** again to choose the actual content type:

   - **Groups** or **Pages** for regular documentation.

   - **Page groups** for structured sections.

   - **OpenAPI reference** entries for imported API specs.

   - **Unpublished page** when drafting content that is not yet visible.

Once you choose a child type (for example, groups), that dropdown can only contain that same type until you refactor the structure.

### Use layers to refactor safely

When your structure evolves, you will often need to insert new levels without rebuilding everything.

Common refactors:

- **Insert a dropdown layer between a tab and its pages**

  - If a tab currently has many pages directly under it, use **Add Parent** on the set of pages to wrap them in a new dropdown (`Getting Started`).

  - Then use **Add Child** inside that dropdown to add additional groups or pages.

- **Split a large dropdown into sub-categories**

  - Use **Add Parent** on a subset of items inside the dropdown to create a nested dropdown.

  - Move related pages or groups into the new nested dropdown.

When you use the Parent vs Child distinction consistently:

- You avoid breaking slugs or moving content unnecessarily.

- You can keep navigation shallow while still grouping related content clearly.

### Validate your structure by switching selectors

After you add or change views, validate how navigation behaves:

1. **Switch between tabs**\
   Confirm that:

   - Each tab label is clear.

   - The sidebar content changes appropriately when you switch tabs.

   - Dropdown categories under each tab are consistent and not duplicated unnecessarily.

2. **Switch dimension selectors**\
   For dimensions like `Version` or `Product`, change the selector values and check:

   - Whether the **tab labels** remain consistent across values where it makes sense.

   - Whether each dimension value has the required views (for example, both `v1` and `v2` have `Guides` and `API Reference` tabs).

3. **Follow a user journey**\
   Navigate as a reader would:

   - Start from a dimension context.

   - Click a tab.

   - Expand dropdowns to find key pages (for example, a quickstart or API reference endpoint).
     If any step feels surprising or hard to find, adjust labels or groupings rather than adding more nesting.

## Step-by-step: create a standard views structure

Use this procedure to set up a common pattern: `Tabs → Dropdown → Pages/Groups` in a single project and dimension.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the dimension context" icon="layers" title-type="p">
    - Open your project in the Web Editor.

    - At the top of the navigation panel, choose the dimension values you want to configure (for example, your main product and default version).

    - Confirm you are editing the correct context before changing views.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add top-level tabs" icon="lucide-panel-top" title-type="p">
    - Look at the top of the navigation tree.

    - If you already see tabs and they match your plan (for example, `Guides`, `API Reference`), you can skip this step.

    - If you do not see tabs:

      - Use the **Add Parent** control at the root level.

      - Choose **Tabs** as the new parent type.

      - Rename the first tab and add additional tabs (for example, `Guides`, `API Reference`, `Tutorials`, `Changelog`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create dropdowns inside each tab" icon="folder" title-type="p">
    - Select a tab (for example, `Guides`) in the navigation tree.

    - Use the **Add Child** control inside the tab.

    - When choosing the child type for the first time under this tab, select **Dropdowns**.

    - Create dropdowns such as:

      - `Getting Started`

      - `How-to guides`

      - `Concepts`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Place content under dropdowns" icon="file-text" title-type="p">
    - For each dropdown (for example, `Getting Started`), select it in the navigation tree.

    - Use **Add Child** to choose the content type:

      - **Groups** if you want another lightweight structure level.

      - **Pages** when you are ready to place individual docs.

      - **OpenAPI reference** if this area is API-centric.

    - Add or move existing pages/groups into the appropriate dropdowns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respect the one-child rule while you adjust" icon="alert-triangle" title-type="p">
    - At each container (tab or dropdown), choose and stick to a single child type:

      - If a tab currently contains dropdowns, all children should be dropdowns.

      - If a dropdown contains pages, do not mix groups at the same level.

    - If an `Add ...` option is missing in the UI, assume the one-child rule is blocking that combination and consider:

      - Wrapping items with **Add Parent** to introduce a new container type.

      - Moving items into another container that uses the desired child type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate by switching tabs and dimensions" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    - Switch between your new tabs and check that each:

      - Has clear dropdown labels.

      - Shows only the content that belongs in that section.

    - Change dimension selectors (for example, different versions) and repeat:

      - Confirm consistent view patterns across related values.

      - Fix any missing or mismatched tabs or dropdowns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Design guidelines and common patterns

### When to use tabs vs dropdowns

Use **tabs** when:

- You need clear, top-level separation between **modes**, **audiences**, or **content types**.

- You have 2–5 major sections that users should be able to switch between quickly.

- You want the sidebar structure to reset depending on the active section.

Use **dropdowns** when:

- You are organizing related content within a single section or tab.

- The sidebar is long enough that scannability becomes an issue.

- You need 2–3 levels of hierarchy for complex topics (for example, deep API reference structures).

If you are unsure, default to:

- A small number of **tabs** at the top level.

- **Dropdowns** in the sidebar under each tab to group content.

### Choosing a nesting pattern

Use these heuristic patterns:

- **Pattern 3:&#x20;****`Tabs → Dropdown → Dropdown`**\
  Good default for most medium-to-large documentation sets:

  - Tabs separate high-level sections.

  - The first level of dropdowns groups major categories.

  - A second dropdown level is available for large categories (for example, many APIs).

- **Pattern 2:&#x20;****`Dropdown → Dropdown`**\
  Use when:

  - Your project is small or focused enough that tabs are not necessary.

  - You want a single continuous sidebar with hierarchical categories.

- **Pattern 1:&#x20;****`Dropdown → Tabs → Dropdown`**\
  Use when:

  - Users first choose a **high-level area** in the sidebar (like `Product A` vs `Product B`).

  - Inside that area, they need multiple parallel sections exposed as tabs.

  - Each tab then has its own dropdown-based sidebar.

### Consistency and maintenance tips

- **Align across dimensions**\
  If you have a `Version` dimension, for example, keep the **tab labels and dropdown structure** consistent across versions to reduce cognitive load.

- **Minimize depth**\
  Even though dropdowns can nest, prefer no more than **two dropdown levels** deep in most projects. Beyond that, content is often better split into an additional tab or dimension.

- **Name views by user intent**\
  Use labels that match how readers think:

  - Prefer `Getting Started` over `Onboarding Docs`.

  - Prefer `API Reference` over `Backend`.

- **Plan before implementing**\
  Sketch your dimension, view, and content hierarchy before editing navigation:

  - What dimensions exist?

  - Which tabs are required in each dimension?

  - How will dropdowns group content inside each tab?

For concrete field names and configuration examples, see:

- [Dimensions](/organize/dimensions) for how dimension selectors define context.

- [Groups](/organize/groups) and [Pages](/organize/pages) for what lives under views.

- [Site configuration](/customize/site-configuration) for JSON configuration patterns of views, tabs, and dropdowns.
