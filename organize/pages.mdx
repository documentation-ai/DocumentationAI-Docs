## Overview

Pages are the fundamental building blocks of your documentation. Each page is:

- Backed by a single MDX file in your repo or workspace
- Referenced from navigation via a configuration entry
- Addressable by a stable path or slug that becomes part of the URL

In the Organize area, you use pages together with groups, views, and dimensions to build a structured docs site:

- **Pages**: Individual content items that users read.
- **Groups / Page Groups**: Containers that nest related pages under a single sidebar item.
- **Views**: Different ways of presenting or filtering the same underlying pages (for example, a product view vs. an API view).
- **Dimensions**: Axes like version, language, or audience that slice your pages without duplicating content.

This page focuses on pages themselves: how they are defined, how they appear in navigation, and how to keep their slugs and paths stable over time.

All content pages must be authored in MDX. When you reference them in configuration, always use the path **without** the `.mdx` extension.

## How pages are referenced

Whether you configure navigation in the Web Editor or via code, each page entry uses a small set of core properties.

### Core page properties

From the [site configuration](/customize/site-configuration), pages support:

- `title` (required): The display name shown in navigation and used in the browser title.
- `path` (optional for internal pages): The relative path to your MDX file, **without** the `.mdx` extension. This is required unless you use `href`.
- `href` (optional for external links): A full URL for links that point outside your docs. Use this instead of `path` for external resources.
- `icon` (optional): A Lucide icon name that appears next to the page in navigation.
- `method` (optional): HTTP method label for API endpoint pages (for example, `GET`, `POST`), used in API navigation.
- `tags` (optional): Free-form labels that help categorize or filter pages in views.

In the Web Editor, the same concepts appear as:

- **Page name** → maps to `title`
- **Page URL (slug)** → maps to `path`
- **Icon** → maps to `icon`

You do not need to think about JSON or YAML when using the Web Editor; it writes the configuration for you.

### Paths, slugs, and URLs

For internal content:

- The **slug** you choose in the Web Editor becomes the `path` used in configuration.
- That path is combined with your site base URL (and any custom subpath) to form the public URL.
- The `path` must be **unique** across your docs so navigation and routing remain unambiguous.

For external content:

- You omit `path` and provide an `href`.
- The page appears in navigation like any other entry but opens the external URL, typically in a new tab.

## Types of pages you can add

In the Web Editor, the **Pages** menu exposes several options that all result in navigation entries, but they behave differently.

### Normal pages

A **Page** is a standard documentation entry backed by an MDX file.

- Created via **Add Page** or the <kbd>+</kbd> button next to the Pages heading.
- You provide:
  - Page name (title)
  - Page URL (slug), which must be unique
  - Optional icon
- Appears directly in the sidebar at the level where you created it.
- Can later be moved into groups or reorganized without changing its underlying MDX file.

Use normal pages for most narrative docs, guides, references, and conceptual content.

### Page group containers

A **Page Group** (sometimes called a group or section) is a container for nested navigation:

- Created via **Add Group** or **Add Page Group**.
- Does **not** require its own MDX file unless you explicitly want a landing page.
- Shows up in the sidebar as a collapsible or expandable item, under which you add or move pages.

Typical patterns:

- Grouping all “Getting Started” content under a single sidebar item.
- Organizing per-product or per-feature sections.
- Separating conceptual guides from API reference pages.

Groups help you model your information architecture without duplicating content.

### OpenAPI-generated pages

When you use **Add OpenAPI Reference**:

- You upload or select an OpenAPI spec.
- The system generates a set of API pages (endpoints, schemas, auth, and more) from that spec.
- These generated pages are automatically added to navigation, typically under an API-specific group.

Key points:

- Generated pages still behave like normal pages in navigation.
- The underlying source is your OpenAPI document instead of a hand-written MDX file.
- You can [organize API reference](/api-documentation-and-playground/organize-api-reference) separately from your main narrative docs while sharing the same global navigation model.

### Unpublished pages

**Unpublished Pages** are content items that exist but are not currently visible in navigation:

- Created when you:
  - Remove a page from navigation but keep the MDX file.
  - Import content that you do not yet want to expose.
- Accessible via **Add Unpublished Page** in the Pages menu, which lets you:
  - Browse existing but unpublished pages.
  - Re-add them to navigation in a new location.

This is useful when you are restructuring navigation or staging new content without deleting source files.

## How pages relate to groups, views, and dimensions

Pages are content; groups, views, and dimensions are ways of organizing or slicing that content.

- **Groups** define the sidebar tree structure. A page can:
  - Live at the root.
  - Be nested under one or more levels of groups.
- **Views** allow the same set of pages to appear in different contexts without duplication. For example:
  - A “Developer” view that shows only technical pages.
  - A “Customer” view that emphasizes onboarding and how-to content.
- **Dimensions** apply cross-cutting filters such as:
  - Version (for example, v1 vs v2)
  - Locale or language
  - Audience or plan level

From a maintenance perspective:

- The MDX file and its `path` identify the page.
- Groups, views, and dimensions control **where** and **when** that page shows up for readers.

## Best practices for naming, slugs, and restructuring

A clear, stable page model makes your docs easier to maintain and safer to evolve.

### Naming and titles

- Use **descriptive titles** that reflect user tasks or topics (for example, “Organize API reference” instead of “API Stuff”).
- Keep titles **concise**; avoid repeating group names if the surrounding context already makes them obvious.
- Align page titles with navigation labels so readers see consistent wording.

### Slugs and paths as stable identifiers

Treat `path` as the page’s stable identifier:

- Choose slugs that are:
  - Lowercase, using `-` as a separator (`organize/pages`, `api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-import`).
  - Meaningful but not over-specific to current UI labels.
- Avoid using:
  - Dates or version numbers in slugs unless versioning is a primary dimension.
  - Team-internal abbreviations that will not make sense later.

When you must change a slug:

1. Update the `path` in configuration or via the Web Editor.
2. Add redirects in [Redirects & Rewrites](/customize/redirects-and-rewrites) so existing links continue to work.
3. Communicate the change if external integrations or apps rely on the old URL.

<Callout kind="tip">

Plan slugs as if they will live for a long time. It is easier to adjust titles and group structure than to rename paths once other systems and users depend on them.

</Callout>

### Safe restructuring

When reorganizing navigation:

- Prefer moving pages between groups over renaming `path`.
- Use **Page Groups** to add hierarchy instead of duplicating pages.
- Use **Unpublished Pages** to temporarily remove items while you redesign structure.
- For API content, consider adjusting OpenAPI grouping or [API reference organization](/api-documentation-and-playground/organize-api-reference) rather than editing many individual pages.

By treating pages as stable content units, and using groups, views, and dimensions as flexible layers on top, you can evolve your docs structure confidently without breaking URLs or confusing readers.
