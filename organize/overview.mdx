title: Organize documentation structure
description: Understand the Dimensions → Views → Content model and how to plan a maintainable documentation structure in Documentation.AI.

## Why organization matters

Good content is not enough if people cannot find it.

In Documentation.AI, navigation is a first-class concern for both human readers and AI agents. A clear organizing model helps you:

- Avoid duplicated sections and hard-to-maintain sidebars
- Plan for product growth, versions, and languages
- Keep navigation consistent across Web Editor and code-based workflows
- Give AI features a predictable map of your docs

This page introduces the core organizing model and points you to the detailed guides for dimensions, views, groups, and pages.

If you work primarily from the code editor, also review [Organize Content Structure](/write-and-publish/code-editor/organize) to see how the same concepts map to `documentation.json`.

## The core model: Dimensions → Views → Content

Documentation.AI uses a three-layer navigation architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  A[Dimensions<br/>Define Context] --> B[Views<br/>Define Navigation]
  B --> C[Content<br/>Define Documentation]
```

At a high level:

1. **Dimensions** define _where_ the reader is.
2. **Views** define _how_ navigation is arranged in that context.
3. **Content** defines _what_ the reader can read.

### Dimensions: define context

Dimensions answer questions like:

- Which **product** am I looking at?
- Which **version** is this page for?
- Which **language** or **framework** applies?

Use dimensions when you need parallel sets of docs that share structure but differ in content. For example:

- Product A vs. Product B
- Stable vs. Beta versions
- English vs. Spanish

Dimensions give you a consistent frame so that views and content can be reused or aligned across contexts.

### Views: define navigation

Views control how your docs are presented within a dimension context. They answer:

- Which high-level areas are visible at once?
- Do I switch between areas via **tabs** or **dropdowns**?
- How does the sidebar change when I change the view?

Common patterns:

- Top-level tabs for major areas like "Product Guides" and "API"
- A dropdown to select a product or deployment model
- Separate views for "Cloud" vs. "Self-hosted" with their own sidebars

Views do not create new content; they organize which content is visible and how users move between sections.

### Content: define documentation

The content layer is what readers actually consume:

- **Pages**: Markdown/MDX-backed units with unique paths
- **Groups**: Sidebar sections that collect related pages
- **API references** and other structured content types

You shape content structure using **parent/child relationships** (for example, a group containing several pages) while views determine how those structures appear in navigation.

## A practical mental model

When you plan or refactor a docs set, work from the outside in:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Choose your dimensions" icon="layers">

  Decide which axes of variation are real, not just labels.

  - Start with product, version, and language.
  - Only add a dimension if it meaningfully changes content.
  - Prefer fewer dimensions with clear values over many overlapping switches.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Design navigation views" icon="layout-dashboard">

  Within each dimension context, decide how people move around.

  - Use tabs for big, mutually exclusive areas (for example, "Guides" vs. "API").
  - Use dropdowns where the choice feels like a mode or profile (for example, "Cloud" vs. "Self-hosted").
  - Keep the number of top-level choices small and stable.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Shape sidebar groups and pages" icon="folder-tree">

  Once views are defined, structure the actual docs.

  - Create groups for logical sections (for example, "Getting Started", "Advanced Topics").
  - Use clear, action-oriented page titles.
  - Keep nesting shallow; avoid deeply nested hierarchies.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate with real journeys" icon="users">

  Before publishing, test with real workflows.

  - Trace key user journeys: onboarding, integration, troubleshooting.
  - Ensure every journey has a straightforward path with minimal view changes.
  - Adjust dimensions, views, groups, or page placement based on friction.

  </Step>

</Steps>

This approach keeps your organizing decisions deliberate instead of growing ad hoc sidebars over time.

## Best practices

### What usually works well

- **Start with dimensions, not sidebars**  
  Decide context (product, version, language) before tuning group structure.

- **Favor stable top-level choices**  
  Once you add a tab or dropdown, keep it stable so links and AI references stay valid.

- **Keep hierarchies shallow**  
  Aim for 2–3 levels deep: view → group → pages. Deeper nesting increases cognitive load.

- **Reuse patterns across dimensions**  
  Mirror the same group and page structure across versions or languages whenever possible.

- **Name for search and scanability**  
  Use concise, descriptive titles that work in search results and sidebars.

### Common anti-patterns to avoid

- **Using dimensions for cosmetic labels**  
  Do not add a dimension if the content is identical or only slightly different; use a section or callout instead.

- **Too many top-level views**  
  A long row of tabs or multiple nested dropdowns makes navigation harder, not easier.

- **Overloading groups with mixed topics**  
  Avoid groups that contain unrelated pages just to keep the sidebar short.

- **Deep nesting instead of refactoring content**  
  If you find yourself adding a fourth or fifth nesting level, split content into clearer sections or new groups.

- **Frequent renames without redirects**  
  Changing page titles and paths often can break links and confuse users; plan structure early and evolve it carefully.
