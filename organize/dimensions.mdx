title: Dimensions
description: Plan and configure products, versions, and languages as dimensions for organized, multi-context documentation in Documentation.AI.

## Overview

Dimensions are top-level context selectors that split your documentation into parallel variants. They define _where_ a reader is in your docs: which product, version, or language they are viewing.

Dimensions sit at the top of your navigation architecture:

```mermaid

  A[Dimensions<br/>Define Context] --> B[Views<br/>Define Navigation]
  B --> C[Content<br/>Define Documentation]
```

- **Dimensions** define the context (for example, Product A / v2 / English).
- **Views** define how navigation is presented within that context (tabs, groups, dropdowns).
- **Content** is the actual pages and groups that readers see.

Use this page when you are designing or changing your navigation model, especially before adding products, versions, or languages.

Dimensions are configured at the site level (see [Site Configuration](/customize/site-configuration)) and then used in the Web Editor and Code Editor to organize views and content.

## When to use dimensions

Dimensions are powerful, but you should only add them when your docs truly exist in parallel variants.

### Good use cases

Use a dimension when **the same conceptual docs exist in multiple versions**, and you want readers to switch between them globally:

- **Products**  
  - You have multiple related products with mostly parallel docs (for example, "Cloud", "On‑prem").
  - You want a top-level product selector that changes the entire navigation.

- **Versions**  
  - You maintain multiple active product or API versions (for example, `v1` and `v2`).
  - Readers often need to switch versions while staying on the same topic.

- **Languages**  
  - You provide full or near-full translations (for example, "English" and "Español").
  - You want a language selector that changes all pages, not just a subset.

In the published docs, dimensions appear as dropdown selectors near the top of the site.

### When *not* to use dimensions

Do **not** use dimensions for every variation or audience. Prefer standard navigation (groups, pages, tabs) when:

- Only a few pages differ per version or product.
- You are targeting audiences (for example, Admin vs Developer) that share most content but need different entry points.
- You just need a small number of platform-specific notes or code samples.

In these cases, use:

- [Tabs](/components/tabs) within a single page (for example, "JavaScript / Python").
- Separate groups in your navigation (for example, "Admin Guide" and "Developer Guide").
- [Callout](/components/callout) blocks to highlight role-specific details.

<Callout kind="tip">

Start with **no dimensions**. Add a dimension only after you can clearly name the variants and you expect them to stay in place for a while (for example, long‑lived versions or products).

</Callout>

## How dimensions interact with views and content

Dimensions are the outermost layer. Once a reader selects values for all active dimensions (for example, Product B / v2 / English), they see a navigation tree that is specific to that context.

### Dimensions → views

Within each dimension combination, you define **views**:

- Views control sidebar organization (groups, tabs, dropdowns).
- Each view lives **inside** a single dimension context.
- You can reuse patterns across contexts (for example, each product has `Getting Started`, `Guides`, `API Reference` groups), but the structure is configured independently.

Examples of view-level elements:

- Groups such as "Getting Started", "API Documentation".
- Tabs used for navigation sections.
- Dropdowns that introduce another navigation level.

### Views → content

Within a view, you attach **content**:

- Pages (`*.mdx` files or Web Editor pages).
- Nested groups of pages.
- API reference sections from imported OpenAPI schemas.

The same conceptual page can appear in:

- Multiple dimension contexts (for example, a shared FAQ reused across products).
- Different views within a dimension (for example, a "Quickstart" linked from both "Overview" and "API Reference").

### Constraints and the one-child rule

Navigation inside a dimension still follows the normal structural rules from the Web Editor:

- Each container has **exactly one child type**.
  - A tab can contain **pages** _or_ **groups** _or_ **dropdowns**.
  - A dropdown can contain **pages** _or_ **groups** _or_ **tabs** _or_ other dropdowns.
- The Editor and site configuration tools only show valid "Add ..." options at each level.

Dimensions do not change these rules; they simply scope which tree of containers and pages is active.

## Designing dimensions: guidelines and pitfalls

Use this section as a checklist when you plan or refactor dimensions.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Decide if you truly need a dimension" icon="help-circle">

  - List your current and planned variants (products, versions, languages).
  - Ask whether readers must **switch context globally**, or if a few local differences are enough.
  - If most content is shared and differences are small or short‑lived, avoid adding a dimension.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a single root dimension" icon="arrow-right">

  - Your navigation must start with one dimension type at the root level.
  - Typical root choices:
    - Product → then Version → then Language
    - Product → then Language
    - Version only (for a single product with multiple API versions)
  - Pick the root based on what users think about **first** when arriving at your docs.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep the number of dimensions small" icon="settings">

  - Most sites work well with **one or two** dimensions.
  - Three dimensions (Product + Version + Language) are possible but more complex to maintain.
  - If your matrix of combinations starts to feel large or sparse, reconsider whether you can:
    - Drop a dimension.
    - Represent some variation inside pages (tabs, callouts).
    - Merge rarely used variants.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Align views across variants where it helps" icon="columns-3">

  - Within a dimension, keep major groups consistent:
    - Use the same group names and order where possible.
    - Mirror key entry points (for example, "Quickstart", "API Reference").
  - This makes it easy for readers to switch product or version and stay oriented.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Plan for lifecycle changes" icon="clock">

  - Versions and some products eventually deprecate.
  - Decide ahead of time how you will:
    - Mark older variants as legacy or deprecated.
    - Hide or demote variants once usage is low.
    - Redirect readers from removed variants to supported ones.
  - Keep at least one clearly marked "current" path to reduce confusion.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Common pitfalls

Avoid these patterns when designing dimensions:

- **Over‑segmenting**  
  Creating dimensions for every role, plan, or platform when a single docs tree with tabs and callouts would be simpler.

- **Uneven variants**  
  Having many pages in one variant and only a few in another, leaving large gaps or empty navigation states.

- **Frequent reconfiguration**  
  Changing dimension types or order often. This makes URLs, bookmarks, and mental models unstable for readers.

- **Deep nesting with many dimensions**  
  Combining several dimensions with heavily nested views. This is hard to reason about and maintain for both humans and AI agents.

<Callout kind="danger">

Before adding or changing dimensions, map a few **end-to-end user journeys** (for example, "New API user for Product B / v2 / English") and confirm they can find key pages with minimal context switching.
