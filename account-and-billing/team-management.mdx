## User Roles Overview

Documentation.ai has two user roles for organization members:

### Admin Role

**Full access permissions:**

- Delete and manage the organization

- Manage team members (invite, remove, change roles)

- Manage documentation (publish, write, create, edit, delete docs)

- Make changes to projects and settings

- Publish documentation

### Viewer Role

**Read-only permissions:**

- View all documentation under the organization

- Cannot make any changes or edits

- Cannot manage team members or organization settings

- Cannot publish or modify documentation

**Important**: User roles are specific to each organization. The same user can have different roles in different organizations.

## Access Control

### Organization-Wide Permissions

- User roles apply to the entire organization and all its projects

- Admins have full control across all documentation projects

- Viewers have read-only access across all documentation projects

### Multi-Organization Users

- Users can be members of multiple organizations

- They may have different roles in each organization

- Role permissions only apply within each specific organization

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

- **Use Admin role for**: Team leads, content managers, developers who need full access

- **Use Viewer role for**: Stakeholders, clients, or team members who only need to read documentation

### Security

- Regularly review team member access

- Remove users who no longer need access

- Use Viewer role as default unless full access is required

## Troubleshooting

**Can't invite users?** Ensure you have Admin role in the organization.

**User not receiving invitation?** Check their spam/promotions folder or resend the invitation.

**Permission denied errors?** Verify the user has the correct role for their intended actions.
