## Understanding Editor Seats

### What Counts as an Editor Seat

- Users with **Admin role** in your organization

- Users who can create, edit, or publish documentation

- **Viewer role** users do NOT count toward editor seat limits

### When You Reach Editor Limits

- Cannot invite additional Admin users

- Existing Admin users retain full access

- Must upgrade plan or remove existing editors to add new ones

### Managing Editor Seats

1. Go to **Settings** → **Organization Settings** → **Members**

2. View current Admin users (these count as editor seats)

3. Change user roles from Admin to Viewer to free up seats

4. Remove users who no longer need editing access

## AI Assistant Answer Limits

### What Counts as an Answer

- Each response from the AI assistant to user questions

- Responses generated from your documentation content

- API calls to the AI assistant service

### When You Reach AI Limits

- AI assistant becomes unavailable until next reset

- Users see a message indicating limit reached

- All other features continue working normally

### Managing AI Usage

- Monitor usage in your billing dashboard

- Encourage efficient use of AI assistant

- Consider upgrading if regularly hitting limits

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Check Current Usage

1. Go to **Settings** → **Organization Settings** → **Billing**

2. View usage dashboard showing:

   - Current editor seats used

## What Happens at Reset

### Monthly Reset Schedule

- **Editor seats** are ongoing (not reset monthly)

### Billing Date Examples
