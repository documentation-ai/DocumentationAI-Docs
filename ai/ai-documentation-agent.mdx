## What the AI Documentation Agent is

The AI Documentation Agent is a workspace-aware writing assistant built directly into the Web Editor. It helps you draft new pages, improve existing content, apply Documentation.AI components correctly, and refactor structure while keeping your site configuration in mind.

<Callout kind="info">
  Agent can now refer to connected repositories for conten, the Agent can read code files and recent commits from those specific repositories to make documentation changes.
</Callout>

## Where to find it in the Web Editor

You can open the Agent by clicking on the "AI Agent" icon from the bottom right corner of the Editor. When open, it displays a conversational panel where you can request changes.

## Core capabilities

The Agent focuses on practical, page-level actions that accelerate your writing flow.

### Draft new pages

You can ask the Agent to create structured content aligned to your component patterns. Useful prompt styles include:

- *Draft a high-level overview of authentication options using clear sections and a Callout.*

- *Create a conceptual introduction to our API docs with Tabs for language variations.*

- *Turn these raw notes into a well‑structured guide with Columns and Cards.*

- *Generate a clean MDX draft for a new page that follows existing heading patterns.*

### Rewrite and edit existing content

The Agent can revise the current page while preserving structure, improving clarity, or applying components more consistently.

- *Rewrite this section for clarity and shorten sentences without changing the technical meaning.*

- *Refactor this page so that it begins with context, then prerequisites, then a Steps section.*

- *Improve the flow of this page while keeping all technical details intact.*

### Apply Documentation.AI components

You can ask the Agent to add Cards, Columns, Steps, Mermaid diagrams, Tabs, Callouts, Expandables, and more.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Ask for component-aware edits like *Convert this unordered list into a Steps sequence* or *Wrap these three links in a Columns layout using Cards.*
</Callout>

### Generate API documentation and code samples

The Agent can help you write request and response examples, create structured ParamField or ResponseField sections, or draft introductions for endpoints already imported via OpenAPI.

- *Generate a client-side fetch sample for this POST endpoint.*

- *Write a Python example for the same request.*

- *Add ParamField and ResponseField examples for this endpoint.*

<CodeGroup show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>

```ts
const res = await fetch("/v1/payments", {
  method: "POST"
});
```

```python
import requests
res = requests.post("/v1/payments")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Keep docs aligned with code changes

When you use the [GitHub Integration](/integrations-and-workflows/github-integration) and connect context repositories to a project, the Agent can use code files and recent commits from those repositories as context while editing your docs.

Point the Agent at the relevant change by sharing a commit URL, PR link, or commit hash in your prompt, or by pasting a short diff or summary. Then ask it to update or propose changes to the affected documentation pages.

Example prompts:

- *Here is the PR link that renames the `customer_id` field to `user_id`. Find all affected API docs in this project and propose updated wording.*

- *This commit adds a new `DELETE /v1/teams/{team_id}` endpoint in our context repo. Draft a new reference page that matches the style of our existing team endpoints.*

- *Use this diff to update parameter descriptions for `POST /v1/sessions` and call out the new `expires_after` field in a Callout.*

- *Review this PR that changes how rate limits work and suggest updates to the rate limits and error codes documentation.*

- *This commit deprecates the `mode` query parameter. Propose how to mark it as deprecated in our API reference and add a short migration note.*

<Callout kind="info">
  The Agent reads from the specific context repositories linked to your documentation project. It does not browse all of your GitHub data, and it treats those repositories as read-only context while it plans and edits documentation.
</Callout>

### Restructure and refactor pages

If a page has grown too long or disorganized, ask the Agent to propose a more readable flow. It can:

- Identify sections to split.

- Suggest consistent heading hierarchy.

- Highlight missing prerequisite or context sections.

- Apply component-based layouts to replace long text blocks.

<Expandable title="Prompt templates for restructuring" default-open="false">

  * *Review this entire page and propose a clearer structure.*

  * *Rewrite this page following overview → key concepts → steps → examples → next steps.*

  * *Suggest how to break this page into smaller, focused pages.*

</Expandable>

## Example prompts you can use immediately

Below are practical prompts tailored for Web Editor flows.

- *Here are my raw notes. Turn them into a clean conceptual page using Callout and Columns components.*

- *Check this page for component errors and rewrite with valid MDX.*

- *Summarize this section and keep only essential details.*

## Limitations to keep in mind

The Agent is in active beta. Treat its output as a strong starting point, not a final draft.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always review generated content before publishing. The Agent avoids component misuse, but manual oversight ensures accuracy. For code-aware edits, the Agent only reads from context repositories connected to the current documentation project and cannot modify those repositories. If a commit or PR is not in a connected repository, you may need to paste the relevant diff, description, or key details into your prompt.
</Callout>

### Credit usage

Most tasks use a small number of credits. More complex multi-section rewrites or full-page drafts may cost more. For details, see the [AI Credits](/ai/ai-credits) page.

## When to use the Agent vs editing manually

Use the Agent when:

- You want a first draft quickly.

- You need structural help or component rewrites.

- You want examples, API sections, or improved clarity.

- You are refactoring a page and want suggestions.

- You want to align docs with recent code changes from connected context repositories.

Edit manually when:

- You are making small fixes or micro-adjustments.

- You need pixel-perfect formatting or subtle wording changes.

- The page contains project-specific details the Agent is not aware of.
