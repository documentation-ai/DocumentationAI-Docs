## How AI credits work

Documentation.AI uses credits for two AI features:

- The **AI Documentation Agent** (editor-facing)

- The **AI Assistant** or **Ask AI** widget (end-user facing)

Only these features consume credits.

  Credits are only used when an AI action is executed. Browsing, editing, and normal site usage do not consume credits.
</Callout>

## AI Assistant / Ask AI

The [AI Assistant](/ai/ai-assistant) powers the on-page **Ask AI** widget for your end users.

Each end user question sent through the AI Assistant costs **exactly 0.1 credit**.

Credit consumption is the same regardless of how long the answer is or which page the user is on. For example, if you are on the professional plan with 500 credits, your customers can ask a maximum of 5,000 questions per month.

## AI Documentation Agent

The [AI Documentation Agent](/ai/ai-documentation-agent) performs edits and content changes inside your docs. Credit usage varies based on task complexity: small updates cost fewer credits, while larger structural changes cost more.

Common examples (actual usage may vary slightly depending on the size of your documents):

| Work performed                                     | Approx. credits |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Adjust headings, spacing, or tables                | 0.30            |
| Edit content within a single section               | 0.40            |
| Create a new page with sections, content and links | 1.10            |
| Significant edits across multiple pages            | 1.80            |

## Where to view credit usage

You can view AI credit usage and costs from the **Usage** section of your Documentation.AI dashboard under **Settings → AI usage**.
