## How AI credits work

Documentation.AI uses credits for two features:

- The **AI Documentation Agent** (editor-facing)

- The **AI Assistant** or **Ask AI** widget (end-user facing)

Only these features consume credits.

  Credits are only used when an AI action is executed. Browsing, editing, and normal site usage do not consume credits.
</Callout>

## AI Assistant / Ask AI

Each end user question sent through the AI Assistant costs **exactly 1 credit**.

The cost is the same regardless of how long the answer is or which page the user is on.

## AI Documentation Agent

The AI Documentation Agent performs edits and content changes inside your docs.\
Credit usage varies based on task complexity. Small updates cost less, larger structural changes cost more.

Common examples (actual usage may vary slightly depending on the size of your documents):

| Task example                                      | Work done                                  | Approx. credits |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| "Fix the formatting in this section"              | Adjusts headings, spacing, or tables       | 0.30            |
| "Rewrite this paragraph for clarity"              | Edits content within a single section      | 0.50            |
| "Add a new page summarizing our API rate limits"  | Creates a new page with sections and links | 1.10            |
| "Restructure this guide into steps with headings" | Significant edits across multiple sections | 1.40            |
