The **MCP Server** exposes your documentation hosted in Documentation.AI to external AI tools. It provides a single tool, `searchDocumentation`, which performs grounded search across your content using the same relevance ranking as your in-product AI Assistant.

This allows AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and other MCP‑compatible IDE or CLI clients to query and reference **your documentation**. Most MCP clients will automatically call `searchDocumentation` when the model needs additional context.

## What the MCP Server provides

- The `searchDocumentation` tool for querying your indexed documentation

- Unified search across pages, headings, API reference, and snippets

- The same ranking and grounding used by the in‑app AI Assistant

- Read‑only retrieval access (no content modification)

## Where to access the MCP Server

You can find your MCP endpoint in the dashboard, under the **MCP Server** section in the sidebar.

Your MCP Server URL typically follows one of these formats when you add the custom domain

- `https://docs.yourdomain.com/_mcp`

- `https://yourdomain.com/docs/_mcp`

The screenshot above shows the MCP Server URL for our own documentation at `https://documentation.ai/docs` which is `https://documentation.ai/docs/_mcp`
