The **MCP Server** exposes your own documentation hosted in Documentation.AI to external AI tools. It provides a single tool, `searchDocumentation`, which performs a grounded search over your product's content exactly as your in-product AI Assistant does.

It allows AI tools such as Chatgpt, Claude , Cursor, and other MCP-compatible IDE or CLI clients to retrieve and reference **your documentation**. In most MCP chat clients, you simply chat normally and the model will call `searchDocumentation` automatically when it needs context from your docs.

## What the MCP Server provides

- The `searchDocumentation` tool for querying **your** indexed documentation

- Unified search across your pages, headings, API reference, and snippets

- The same ranking and grounding used by your in-app AI Assistant

- Read-only access intended for retrieval, not content modification
