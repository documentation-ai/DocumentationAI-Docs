## Overview

The AI Assistant helps readers, customers, and internal teams get fast, accurate answers based on your published documentation. When someone clicks **Ask AI**, the assistant searches your docs, reasons over the content it finds, and returns grounded answers with citations.

Unlike a generic chatbot, the assistant is:

- **Docs‑aware** – it relies on your published documentation as its source of truth.

- **Agentic** – it plans how to answer, not just reply turn‑by‑turn.

- **Cited** – it shows where each answer came from in your docs.

  The AI Assistant/Ask AI is separate from the AI Documentation Agent. The **Assistant** answers questions for end users and internal teams.
  The **Documentation Agent** helps you write and edit content. See [AI Documentation Agent](/ai/ai-documentation-agent) for details.

## Who the assistant is for

Use the assistant when you want people to self‑serve answers instead of opening a support ticket or asking someone internally.

Typical users:

- **End users / customers** browsing your docs

- **Support teams** resolving or triaging issues

- **Account management / success teams** guiding onboarding and expansion

- **Internal teams** learning how your product works

Examples:

- A new user asks: “How do I authenticate against the API?”

- A support engineer asks: “What are the rate limits for webhooks?”

- An account manager asks: “What’s the recommended setup for SSO?”

In each case, the assistant answers based on your docs and links back to the relevant pages.

## Why it’s more than just an AI Search

Most chatbots:

- Don’t know your docs structure

- Freely improvise when they’re unsure

- Make it hard to see where an answer came from

The AI Assistant:

- **Retrieves first, then answers** – it searches your docs and uses the retrieved content as grounding.

- **Stays within your content** – it is designed to prefer your docs over general model knowledge.

- **Signals uncertainty** – when it can’t find reliable content, it avoids making confident but unsupported claims.

This makes it safer to use in support and customer‑facing workflows.

## Citations: how they work and why they matter

Every answer from the assistant can include **citations** back to your documentation.

What users see:

- A short answer and explanation in the chat

- One or more citations linked to specific pages (often down to the section)

- The ability to click through to read the full context

Why this is important:

- **Trust** – users can verify information against your canonical docs.

- **Reusability** – support and account teams can safely reuse answers with links in tickets, chats, or emails.

- **Maintainability** – updating your docs improves future answers automatically; you can trace bad answers back to specific content.

If an answer cannot be strongly supported by what’s in your docs, the assistant will either:

- Ask for clarification, or

- Indicate that it doesn’t have enough information, instead of fabricating details.

## Where users access the assistant

Rhe assistant appears in your documentation as an **Ask AI** entry point.

1. They click **Ask AI**.

2. They type a question in natural language.

3. The assistant searches your docs, reasons over the results, and responds with:

   - A concise answer or explanation

   - Optional step‑by‑step guidance

   - Citations and links to relevant pages or sections

## Benefits for admins and doc owners

The AI Assistant can:

- **Improve onboarding** – new users reach first value faster by asking concrete “how do I…” questions.

- **Reduce support tickets** – many basic “where is…” and “how do I…” questions are handled directly in the docs.

- **Make customer‑facing teams faster** – support and AM/CS teams can use the same assistant to pull accurate, cited answers during conversations.

- **Expose documentation gaps** – repeated questions without good citations highlight where your docs need better coverage or structure.
