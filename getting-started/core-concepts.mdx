description: An overview of the core concepts behind Documentation.AI
---
Documentation.AI helps you build documentation that stays accurate, readable, and AI-ready. These core concepts give you a clear mental model of how the platform works, why it is AI-native, and how teams write and maintain content using either the web editor or a code editor.

If you want a quick end-to-end setup, see the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart).

## AI Native

Being AI native means Documentation.AI uses AI and AI-integrated features throughout the product to support both writers and readers. Structured components remain important, but they are one part of a broader, AI-driven workflow.

- **AI agent for writing and maintenance**: Helps draft, rewrite, and refine content in the web editor. See [AI documentation agent](/ai/ai-documentation-agent)

- **AI assistant for readers**: Provides context-aware answers sourced from your documentation. See [Set up AI assistant](/ai/ai-assistant).

- **On-page AI features**: Includes quick actions such as copy helpers and the AI menu for fast explanations. See [On-page AI menu](/ai/ai-menu).

- **MCP server for docs**: Enables AI tools to work with your content safely and predictably.

- **Structured components**: Provide semantic cues that improve AI retrieval and help models understand page structure.

- **Additional AI-aware foundations**: Includes llms-txt guidance and documentation best practices that make your content easier for models to consume.

AI-native features work together so your documentation becomes easier to write, maintain, and explore.

## Two ways to work

Documentation.AI offers two fully synced workflows so every contributor can work in the environment they prefer.

### Web editor

The web editor is ideal for non-technical contributors or teams that want a visual, in-browser editing experience.

- Edit content with a WYSIWYG interface.

- Use slash commands to insert components.

- Organise the pages nav bar.&#x20;

- Use the built-in AI agent to write documentation efficiently.

### Code editor

Use the code editor workflow if your team prefers working with local files, git branches, and CI.

- Keep docs versioned alongside your codebase.

- Use your preferred editor, linters, and review tools.

- Commit and merge documentation changes like any other code.

- Ideal for engineering-heavy teams or API reference work.

- Use coding agents such as Cursor or GitHub Copilot or Claude Code with the MCP server to update and maintain docs using AI.

## Components: rich, reusable blocks

Components help you structure content consistently and make pages more readable. They also give AI clearer signals about the meaning of your content.

- Explore all components [here](/components/heading-and-text).

- Use cards, tabs, steps, callouts, and code groups to add structure.

- Combine components to create predictable patterns across your docs.

- Keep content readable while adding hierarchy and clarity.

## API documentation and playground

If your product includes an API, Documentation.AI provides a complete workflow for importing, organizing, and testing endpoints.

- Import schemas with [OpenAPI Import](/api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-import).

- Structure your reference using [Organize API Reference](/api-documentation-and-playground/organize-api-reference).

- Enable live request testing in the interactive playground.

- Keep your API docs synced by updating `openapi.yaml` in your repo.

Together, these concepts give you a solid foundation for building documentation that scales with your product and your team.
