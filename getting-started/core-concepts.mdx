title: Core Concepts
description: Core concepts and architecture that underpin Documentation.AI.
---

Documentation.AI focuses on four concepts. Use these to choose workflows and architecture.

## AI-native architecture

- AI assists across the lifecycle: draft, revise, evaluate, and search.

- Private-by-default controls and clear data handling. See [AI assistant setup](../ai/ai-assistant).

- Tune retrieval and answers with [search configuration](../ai/search-configuration).

- Keep humans in control: AI suggests; you review and publish.

## MDX + component system

- Content is MDX with a rich [component library](../components/component-library).

- Keep prose in markdown; use components for structure, interactivity, and API reference.

- Common building blocks: callouts, code blocks/groups, tables, API request/response.

- Prefer small, reusable sections over long monolithic pages.

## Web and git workflows

- Web editor: collaborative, visual, component-aware. See [Web editor](../write-and-publish/web-editor/overview).

- Git workflow: file-first, PR reviews, branches. See [Code editor](../write-and-publish/code-editor/overview).

- When to use: web for quick edits and non-developers; git for reviews, branching, CI.

- Hybrid is common: authors in web; reviewers in git.

## Deployment options

- Managed hosting with global CDN, SSL, and custom domains. See [Deploy your documentation](../deployment-and-hosting/deploy-your-documentation).

- Self-hosted export for custom infra and CI/CD. See [Build information](../deployment-and-hosting/build-information).

- Public or private spaces; map subpaths or separate domains.
