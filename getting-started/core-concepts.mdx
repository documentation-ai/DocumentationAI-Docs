title: Core Concepts
description: An overview of the core concepts behind Documentation.AI
---
Documentation.AI helps you build documentation that stays accurate, readable, and AI-ready. These core concepts give you a clear mental model of how the platform works, why it is AI-native, and how teams write and maintain content using either the web editor or a code editor.

If you want a quick end-to-end setup, see the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart).

## AI native

AI-native documentation means your content is structured so both humans and AI systems can understand it. This improves search, boosts answer accuracy, and gives teams automated help when writing or maintaining docs.

Here are the key capabilities that support AI-native workflows:

- **Shared search index**: Search and the AI Assistant pull from the same index. When you tune search, you improve AI answers. See [Search Configuration](/ai/search-configuration).

- **On-page help for readers**: The AI Assistant gives context-aware answers directly on your docs. Configure access and behavior in [Set Up the AI Assistant](/ai/ai-assistant).

- **Authoring support**: The AI Agent helps writers draft, edit, and refine content in the web editor.

- **Controlled external access**: Use `llms.txt` to manage what parts of your site external AI tools can crawl. See [llms.txt](/ai/llms-txt).

- **Structured components**: Components provide semantic structure that improves AI retrieval and answer quality.

## Two ways to work

Documentation.AI offers two fully synced workflows so every contributor can work in the environment they prefer.

### Web editor

The web editor is ideal for non-technical contributors or teams that want a visual, in-browser editing experience.

- Edit content with a WYSIWYG interface.

- Use slash commands to insert components.

- No local setup or tooling required.

### Code editor

Use the code editor workflow if your team prefers working with local files, git branches, and CI.

- Keep docs versioned alongside your codebase.

- Use your preferred editor, linters, and review tools.

- Commit and merge documentation changes like any other code.

- Ideal for engineering-heavy teams or API reference work.

## Components: rich, reusable blocks

Components help you structure content consistently and make pages more readable. They also give AI clearer signals about the meaning of your content.

- Explore all components in [Headings and Text](/components/heading-and-text).

- Use cards, tabs, steps, callouts, and code groups to add structure.

- Combine components to create predictable patterns across your docs.

- Keep content readable while adding hierarchy and clarity.

<CodeGroup show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>
  ```markdown
  Use simple markdown for most text. Components can be added only where structure helps.
  ```

  ```tsx
  <Callout kind="tip">

  Place important guidance or reminders inside a styled block.

  </Callout>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## API documentation and playground

If your product includes an API, Documentation.AI provides a complete workflow for importing, organizing, and testing endpoints.

- Import schemas with [OpenAPI Import](/api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-import).

- Structure your reference using [Organize API Reference](/api-documentation-and-playground/organize-api-reference).

- Enable live request testing in the interactive playground.

- Keep your API docs synced by updating `openapi.yaml` in your repo.

## AI features for writers and readers

Documentation.AI includes two AI capabilities, each serving a different audience.

### AI Agent for writers

The AI Agent assists authors working in the web editor. It helps with:

- Drafting or rewriting content

- Proofreading and tightening language

- Suggesting structural improvements

- Speeding up configuration tasks

You remain in control of what is accepted and published.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Learn more" icon="info">
    Visit [Set Up the AI Assistant](/ai/ai-assistant) to understand how AI interacts with your documentation.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Improve search" icon="search">
    Configure search relevance in [Search Configuration](/ai/search-configuration).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### AI Assistant for readers

The AI Assistant helps readers get fast, context-aware answers while staying aligned with your documentation.

- Uses your indexed content as its primary source.

- Appears on the site where you choose.

- Improves alongside your search tuning.

- Respects visibility rules and access controls.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  AI suggestions speed up reading and writing, but all published changes remain fully under your team's control.
