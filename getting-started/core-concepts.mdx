---
Documentation.AI helps teams create clear, accurate docs without needing deep technical skills. Writers can work visually, developers can use files and version control, and everyone benefits from built‑in AI support.

## What Documentation.AI Does

Documentation.AI provides a single place to write, organize, and publish documentation and knowledge bases. It blends simple tools for non‑technical authors with flexible file‑based workflows for developers.

- Write in plain language using markdown with optional components.

- Let AI help with drafting, editing, and search quality.

- Keep everything versioned and reviewable.

- Publish to a fast, secure site with little setup.

  Documentation.AI works equally well for product documentation, internal knowledge bases, onboarding guides, or API references.

## Your Content and Knowledge Base

Your project is made of text files you control. Most pages are MDX files, which means regular markdown plus optional components. A small config file named `documentation.json` helps structure navigation. If you have an API, an `openapi.yaml` file describes your endpoints.

- Organize pages visually or using folders.

- Mix simple markdown with richer components.

- Add metadata to pages with frontmatter.

- Reuse shared sections across your knowledge base.

<Expandable title="What is MDX?" default-open="false">
  MDX is markdown with the option to insert components. You can write plain text or drop in structured blocks like tabs, cards, or steps.

## Two Ways to Work: Web Editor and Code Editor

You can write and manage your docs using the web editor or a code editor. Both always stay in sync.

- The [Web Editor Overview](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview) shows a simple visual editor.

- The [Code Editor Overview](/write-and-publish/code-editor/overview) covers a file‑first, git‑friendly workflow.

- Use the web editor for quick edits or non‑technical contributors.

- Use a code editor for reviews, branches, and automation.

<Columns cols="2">
  <Card title="Web Editor" href="/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview" icon="monitor" horizontal="false">
    The easiest way to write, edit, and preview content.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Code Editor" href="/write-and-publish/code-editor/overview" icon="code" horizontal="false">
    Ideal for developers who prefer local files and git workflows.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Components: Rich, Reusable Blocks

You can enhance pages with structured building blocks called components. They provide layout, interactivity, and clear patterns for docs.

- See all components in the [Components pages](/components/heading-and-text).

- Use cards, tabs, steps, callouts, code groups, and more.

- Keep text readable while adding structure where it helps.

- Reuse components across concepts, guides, and API pages.

<CodeGroup show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>
  ```markdown
  Simple text using standard markdown.
  ```

  ```tsx
  <Callout kind="tip">

  Helpful guidance inside a styled block.

  </Callout>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## API Documentation and Playground (If You Have an API)

If your product includes an API, Documentation.AI lets you import your OpenAPI file, organize endpoints, and offer an interactive playground.

- Import schemas: [OpenAPI Import](/api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-import).

- Structure your reference: [Organize API Reference](/api-documentation-and-playground/organize-api-reference).

- Enable live testing with Authentication and Playground setup.

- Keep your API docs synced with code by updating `openapi.yaml`.

## AI Assistant and On-Page AI

AI helps with writing, proofreading, search quality, and on‑page assistance for readers. You stay in control of what the AI can access.

- Configure the assistant in [Set Up the AI Assistant](/ai/ai-assistant).

- Tune answer accuracy with [Search Configuration](/ai/search-configuration).

- Add interactive help with the [AI Menu](/ai/ai-menu).

- Manage what external AI tools can access using [`llms.txt`](/ai/llms-txt).
