</Expandable>
<Expandable title="Navigation Structure">

```json
{
  "Getting Started": ["Introduction", "Getting Started Guide"],
  "API Reference": ["Authentication", "Endpoints", "Examples"],
  "Resources": ["Guides & Tutorials", "FAQ"]
}
```

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

3. Click **+ New Page** and create each page:
   - **Page Title**: `Getting Started Guide` (or choose your own page name)
   - **URL Slug**: `getting-started-guide` 
   - **Parent**: `Getting Started`

[SCREENSHOT: New page creation modal with page details filled out]

4. Repeat for all pages in the structure above

> **Result**: Your site now has a complete navigation structure visible in the sidebar.

### Step 4: Write content with AI assistance

Documentation.AI supports two workflows for creating content. Choose the approach that works best for you:

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Web-Based Editor">

1. Open the "Getting Started Guide" page in the web editor
2. Click the AI Assistant button (robot icon) in the toolbar
3. Enter this prompt (customize for your product):

```text
Write a getting started guide for my product documentation. Include:
- Overview of key features
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Common troubleshooting tips
```

4. Review the AI-generated content and click "Insert"
5. Edit content using the visual block editor
6. Add components by typing "/" commands (e.g., /callout, /codegroup)
7. Publish directly from the web interface

Benefits: Real-time collaboration, visual editing, no git knowledge required

</Expandable>
<Expandable title="Code/IDE Workflow">

1. Set up GitHub integration in Settings → Integrations
2. Clone your documentation repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs.git
```

3. Open in your preferred editor (VS Code, etc.)
4. Create/edit MDX files directly:
   - getting-started/getting-started-guide.mdx
   - Use frontmatter for page metadata
   - Write in Markdown with JSX components

5. Use AI assistance via:
   - Documentation.AI web interface for content generation
   - AI coding assistants in your IDE
   - Copy/paste between web editor and IDE

6. Commit and push changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add getting started guide"
git push origin main
```

7. Changes auto-deploy to your live site

Benefits: Version control, IDE features, git workflows, CI/CD integration

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

[SCREENSHOT: Split view showing web editor on left and VS Code with MDX file on right]

<Callout kind="success">
Both workflows support the same AI features and components. You can even switch between them - start in the web editor and later move to git-based workflows as your team grows.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Add interactive components

Now let's enhance your Getting Started Guide with interactive components. The process differs slightly between workflows:

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Web Editor Components">

1. Position your cursor after the overview section
2. Type `/callout` and select the Callout component
3. Choose "Info" type and add helpful information:
   "Make sure to follow the setup steps in order for the best experience."
4. Type `/codegroup` to add multi-language code examples
5. Configure tabs: "Installation,Configuration,Usage"
6. Fill in code examples for each tab
7. Use the component picker (+) for more options:
   - Tables, images, expandables
   - API documentation components
   - Custom embeds and iframes

Benefits: Visual component insertion, live preview, drag-and-drop

</Expandable>
<Expandable title="Code/IDE Components">

1. Edit your MDX file directly in your code editor
2. Add components using JSX syntax:

<Callout kind="info">
Make sure to follow the setup steps in order for the best experience.
</Callout>

<CodeGroup tabs="Installation,Configuration,Usage">
```bash
# Install your product
npm install your-product
```

```yaml
# Configuration
config:
  api_key: "your-api-key"
```

```javascript
// Usage example
import YourProduct from 'your-product';
const client = new YourProduct();
```
</CodeGroup>

3. Use autocomplete and syntax highlighting in your IDE
4. Preview changes by pushing to git or using local development

Benefits: Code completion, version control, bulk editing, find/replace

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

[SCREENSHOT: Split view showing component picker in web editor and MDX code in VS Code]
