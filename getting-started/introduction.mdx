# Introduction

Documentation.AI is an AI-native documentation platform that helps teams create, maintain, and scale product and API documentation. The platform combines documentation tooling with built-in AI assistance to streamline authoring and maintenance.

## What is Documentation.AI?

Documentation.AI provides a comprehensive solution for technical documentation that serves both human readers and AI agents. The platform includes:

- **Flexible editing workflows** with web-based editor and git integration
- **AI assistant** for content generation and optimization
- **API documentation tools** with interactive playground
- **Custom branding and theming** options
- **Analytics and insights** for content performance
- **Deployment and hosting** with custom domains

## Who uses Documentation.AI?

Documentation.AI serves teams that need to create and maintain technical documentation:

- **Developer teams** building [API documentation](../api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-schema-import) and developer guides
- **Product teams** creating user-facing documentation and help centers
- **Technical writers** managing large-scale [documentation projects](../writing-content/organize-content-structure)
- **Startups to enterprises** requiring scalable documentation solutions

## Core concepts

### AI-native approach

Documentation.AI integrates [AI assistance](../ai/ai-assistant-set-up) throughout the documentation workflow. The AI can help with content generation, optimization, and maintenance while ensuring the final output serves both human readers and AI agents effectively.

### MDX-based content

Content is authored in [MDX](../writing-content/markdown-basics) (Markdown with React components), providing the simplicity of Markdown with the power of interactive components. This approach enables rich, interactive documentation while maintaining content portability.

### Component library

The platform includes a comprehensive [component library](../components/component-library) for creating consistent, accessible documentation. Components range from basic text formatting to complex API documentation elements.

### Flexible workflows

Documentation.AI supports both web-based and git-based workflows to fit different team preferences:

- **Web-based workflow** - Edit content directly in the browser using a structured, block-based editor with real-time collaboration
- **Git-based workflow** - Manage content as files in your repository with standard git operations via [GitHub integration](../integrations-and-workflows/github-integration)
- **Hybrid approach** - Combine both workflows as needed for different team members or content types

### Deployment flexibility

Documentation can be [deployed](../deployment-and-hosting/deploy-your-documentation) to Documentation.AI's hosting infrastructure or exported for deployment to custom infrastructure. [Custom domains](../deployment-and-hosting/custom-domain) and subpaths are supported for brand consistency.

## Key features

### Content creation

- **[Web editor](../writing-content/web-editor)** with WYSIWYG and markdown modes for browser-based editing
- **Git integration** for file-based workflows with [GitHub](../integrations-and-workflows/github-integration), GitLab, and other providers
- **Real-time collaboration** for team editing in web interface
- **[Version control](../writing-content/content-versioning-and-history)** with content history and git-based versioning
- **[Image and media management](../writing-content/images-and-media)** with optimization

### AI assistance

- **Content generation** for documentation sections
- **[Search optimization](../ai/search-configuration)** for better discoverability
- **Content analysis** and improvement suggestions
- **AI-powered search** for end users

### API documentation

- **[OpenAPI schema import](../api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-schema-import)** for automatic API reference generation
- **[Interactive playground](../api-documentation-and-playground/interactive-playground-setup)** for API testing
- **[Code generation](../api-documentation-and-playground/code-generation)** in multiple programming languages
- **[Authentication setup](../api-documentation-and-playground/api-authentication)** for secure API testing

### Customization

- **[Custom branding](../design-and-customization/branding)** with logos, colors, and fonts
- **[Theme customization](../design-and-customization/theme)** for light and dark modes
- **[Navigation configuration](../design-and-customization/navigation-and-sidebar)** with flexible sidebar structure
- **[Custom CSS and JavaScript](../design-and-customization/custom-css-and-javascript)** for advanced customization

### Analytics and insights

- **[User behavior tracking](../analytics-and-insights/user-analytics)** to understand content usage
- **[Search analytics](../analytics-and-insights/search-and-ai-assistant-analytics)** to optimize content discoverability
- **AI assistant usage** metrics and [feedback collection](../analytics-and-insights/user-feedback)
- **Performance monitoring** for documentation sites
