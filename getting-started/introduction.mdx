Documentation.AI is an AI-native documentation platform that helps teams create, maintain, and scale product and API documentation. The platform combines documentation tooling with built-in AI assistance to streamline authoring and maintenance.

## What is Documentation.AI?

Documentation.AI provides a comprehensive solution for technical documentation that serves both human readers and AI agents. The platform includes:

- **Flexible editing workflows** with web-based editor and git integration

- **AI assistant** for content generation and optimization

- **API documentation tools** with interactive playground

- **Custom branding and theming** options

- **Analytics and insights** for content performance

- **Deployment and hosting** with custom domains

## Who uses Documentation.AI?

Documentation.AI serves teams that need to create and maintain technical documentation:

- **Developer teams** building [API documentation](../api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-schema-import) and developer guides

- **Product teams** creating user-facing documentation and help centers

- **Technical writers** managing large-scale [documentation projects](../write-and-publish/web-editor/organize)

- **Startups to enterprises** requiring scalable documentation solutions

## Core concepts

### AI-native approach

Documentation.AI integrates [AI assistance](../ai/ai-assistant) throughout the documentation workflow. The AI can help with content generation, optimization, and maintenance while ensuring the final output serves both human readers and AI agents effectively.

### MDX-based content

Content is authored in MDX (Markdown with React components), providing the simplicity of Markdown with the power of interactive components. This approach enables rich, interactive documentation while maintaining content portability.

### Component library

The platform includes a comprehensive [component library](../components/component-library) for creating consistent, accessible documentation. Components range from basic text formatting to complex API documentation elements.

### Flexible workflows

Documentation.AI supports both web-based and git-based workflows to fit different team preferences:

- **Web-based workflow** - Edit content directly in the browser using a structured, block-based editor with real-time collaboration

- **Git-based workflow** - Manage content as files in your repository with standard git operations via [Code editor](../write-and-publish/code-editor/overview)

- **Hybrid approach** - Combine both workflows as needed for different team members or content types

### Deployment flexibility

Documentation can be [deployed](../deployment-and-hosting/deploy-your-documentation) to Documentation.AI's hosting infrastructure or exported for deployment to custom infrastructure. [Custom domains](../deployment-and-hosting/custom-domain) and subpaths are supported for brand consistency.

## Key features

### Content creation

- [**Web editor**](../write-and-publish/web-editor/overview) with WYSIWYG and markdown modes for browser-based editing

- **Git integration** for file-based workflows with GitHub, GitLab, and other providers via [Code editor](../write-and-publish/code-editor/overview)

- **Real-time collaboration** for team editing in web interface

- **Version control** with content history and git-based versioning

- [**Image and media management**](../write-and-publish/web-editor/images-and-media) with optimization

### AI assistance

- **Content generation** for documentation sections

- [**Search optimization**](../ai/search-configuration) for better discoverability

- **Content analysis** and improvement suggestions

- **AI-powered search** for end users

### API documentation

- [**OpenAPI schema import**](../api-documentation-and-playground/openapi-schema-import) for automatic API reference generation

- [**Interactive playground**](../api-documentation-and-playground/interactive-playground-setup) for API testing

- [**Code generation**](../api-documentation-and-playground/code-generation) in multiple programming languages

- **Authentication setup** for secure API testing

### Customization

- [**Colors and typography customization**](../customization-and-configuration/colors-and-typography) for light and dark modes

- [**Navigation configuration**](../customization-and-configuration/navigation-and-sidebar) with flexible sidebar structure

### Analytics and insights

- [**User behavior tracking**](../analytics-and-insights/user-analytics) to understand content usage

- [**Search analytics**](../analytics-and-insights/search-and-ai-assistant-analytics) to optimize content discoverability

- **AI assistant usage** metrics and [feedback collection](../analytics-and-insights/user-feedback)

- **Performance monitoring** for documentation sites
