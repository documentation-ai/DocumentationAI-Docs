description: Use Git-based workflows and MDX in your preferred code editor to write, organize, and publish documentation with Documentation.AI.
---

## Overview

The code editor workflow lets you write and manage documentation in your preferred development environment (for example, VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf). You work with `.mdx` files locally, commit changes to Git, and Documentation.AI builds and deploys from your connected repository.

Use this page as the single reference for:

- When to use the code editor workflow
- How to write docs in MDX with Documentation.AI components
- Recommended Git workflows for collaboration and previews
- How to organize files and navigation with `documentation.json`

If you prefer visual editing, real-time collaboration, and publishing without Git, see the [Web Editor](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview).

</Callout>

## When to use the code editor workflow

Choose the code editor workflow when you want:

- **Developer workflows**  
  Use Git branching, pull requests, code reviews, and CI-style checks.

- **Bulk editing and refactors**  
  Run project-wide search and replace, automate changes with scripts, and refactor content across many files.

- **Integration with code**  
  Keep docs in the same repo as your product code, or in a dedicated docs repo with the same tooling (linting, formatting, CI).

- **Extension ecosystem**  
  Use editor extensions for markdown linting, spell-check, formatting, and AI assistance.

- **Offline work**  
  Edit docs without internet access and push changes when you are back online.

Use the [Web Editor](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview) when you need:

- Quick, one-off content edits without touching Git
- Non-technical contributors editing docs
- Visual content editing and drag-and-drop media management

## Set up your project

### 1. Connect your repository

1. In the Documentation.AI dashboard, open **Settings**.
2. Connect your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or another supported provider).
3. Select the repository that contains (or will contain) your documentation.
4. Choose the branch to deploy (typically `main` or `master`).

After the connection, pushes to the configured branch trigger an automatic build and deployment.

### 2. Clone and open in your editor

Clone your docs repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/docs.git
cd docs
```

Open the folder in your editor:

- **VS Code**: `code .` or use **File → Open Folder**
- **Cursor**: `cursor .` or drag the folder into the app

## Project structure and navigation

Documentation.AI reads your `.mdx` files and `documentation.json` to generate your site.

A typical structure:

```bash
docs/
├── documentation.json       # Site configuration and navigation
├── getting-started/
│   ├── introduction.mdx
│   └── quickstart.mdx
├── api/
│   ├── authentication.mdx
│   └── openapi.yaml         # Optional OpenAPI for API docs
└── guides/
    └── integrations.mdx
```

### File and folder naming guidelines

To keep your docs maintainable:

- Use **lowercase-with-hyphens** for filenames and directories  
  - `api-authentication.mdx` instead of `APIAuthentication.mdx`
- Keep a **shallow structure** where possible  
  - Prefer `guides/integrations.mdx` over deeply nested trees
- Match **directory structure to navigation groups**  
  - For example, a `getting-started/` folder for “Getting Started” pages
- Use **one main concept per page**  
  - Avoid very long “miscellaneous” pages

### `documentation.json` basics

The `documentation.json` file controls:

- Sidebar navigation (groups, pages, and their order)
- Icons and labels in navigation
- Some site-wide configuration and metadata

A minimal example of adding a new page:

```json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Documentation",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            { "title": "Introduction", "path": "getting-started/introduction" },
            { "title": "Quickstart", "path": "getting-started/quickstart" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Best practices:

- Keep `path` values aligned with your file tree (for example, `getting-started/introduction` → `getting-started/introduction.mdx`).
- Prefer **absolute paths from the docs root** for internal links (for example, `[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)`).
- Update `documentation.json` when you add, rename, or remove pages so navigation stays in sync.

For more advanced organization patterns, see the broader [Organize](/organize/overview) docs.

## Writing docs in MDX

### MDX fundamentals

Each page is an `.mdx` file with frontmatter and content:

````mdx
---
title: API Authentication
description: Learn how to authenticate with our API
---

## API authentication

Authenticate using a bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
````

Guidelines:

- Always include at least `title` and `description` in frontmatter.
- Use markdown for headings, text, lists, and tables.
- Use MDX components (JSX-style tags) for richer patterns like callouts, steps, and parameter tables.

### Using Documentation.AI components

Documentation.AI ships a set of MDX components tailored for docs. Common examples:

````mdx
<Callout kind="info">

Tokens expire after 24 hours; refresh them using the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.

</Callout>

<ParamField path="userId" param-type="string" required="true">

Unique identifier for the user

</ParamField>
````

For grouped or multi-step content:

````mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API token" icon="key">

  Go to your account settings, then create a new token with read access.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add token to your environment" icon="terminal">

  Store the token in an environment variable such as `API_TOKEN`.

  </Step>
</Steps>
````

For code in multiple languages:

````mdx
<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
const user = await getUser(userId)
```
```python
user = get_user(user_id)
```
</CodeGroup>
````

Component references:

- [Headings and Text](/components/heading-and-text)
- [Code and Groups](/components/code-blocks-and-groups)
- [Callout](/components/callout)

### Internal links

Use absolute paths from the docs root:

- ✅ `[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)`
- ✅ `[Web Editor](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview)`
- ❌ `../getting-started/quickstart` (relative paths are harder to maintain)

This keeps links stable even if you move files or change navigation groups.

## Git workflow and collaboration

Documentation.AI uses your Git repository as the single source of truth. A typical cycle:

1. Edit content locally in your editor.
2. Commit changes to a branch.
3. Push to your Git provider.
4. Open a pull request (PR).
5. Documentation.AI builds previews for the PR and deploys when merged.

### Recommended branch workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a feature branch" icon="git-branch">

  Start from your main branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git checkout -b add-webhook-docs
  ```

  Use descriptive branch names such as `fix-typos-billing-page` or `add-api-errors-doc`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit and preview locally" icon="edit">

  - Create or edit `.mdx` files.
  - Update `documentation.json` if navigation changes.
  - Use your editor's markdown preview (for example, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> in VS Code) for a quick content view.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit with clear messages" icon="check">

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add webhook setup documentation"
  ```

  Keep commits focused on related changes to make reviews easier.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and open a PR" icon="upload">

  ```bash
  git push origin add-webhook-docs
  ```

  Then open a pull request in your Git provider. Documentation.AI automatically builds a preview for the PR so reviewers can see the rendered docs.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and merge" icon="check-circle">

  - Use the preview build to verify formatting, navigation, and links.
  - Address review comments and push updates to the same branch.
  - When ready, merge the PR into the deployment branch (for example, `main`).

  Documentation.AI then runs a production build and publishes changes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Git workflow best-practice checklist

<Expandable.Root>
  <Expandable title="Before you open a pull request" defaultOpen>
    - [ ] Ensure frontmatter `title` and `description` are set and accurate  
    - [ ] Check that new or renamed pages are added to `documentation.json`  
    - [ ] Run spell-check or linting in your editor, if configured  
    - [ ] Verify internal links use absolute paths (for example, `/getting-started/quickstart`)  
    - [ ] Preview markdown in your editor for obvious formatting issues  
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="During review">
    - [ ] Use Git diffs to review content changes by section  
    - [ ] Open the Documentation.AI preview build to see the rendered pages  
    - [ ] Confirm that navigation, breadcrumbs, and titles look correct  
    - [ ] Click through new or updated links to catch 404s early  
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="After merge">
    - [ ] Wait for the Documentation.AI build to complete  
    - [ ] Spot-check key pages in production (especially new ones)  
    - [ ] Update any external references (for example, product UI links) if slugs changed  
  </Expandable>
</Expandable.Root>

<Callout kind="tip">

Use feature branches and PRs even for documentation-only changes. Documentation.AI generates preview builds for pull requests, which helps reviewers catch structural or navigation issues before they reach production.

</Callout>

## Troubleshooting and common issues

If something looks wrong after a change:

- **Navigation is missing or out of order**  
  - Check the corresponding `path` entries in `documentation.json`.  
  - Make sure filenames and directory names match the `path` values.

- **Page builds but content is broken**  
  - Look for invalid MDX (for example, unclosed components or unescaped `{` in prose).  
  - Ensure all components use valid props (for example, `kind="info"` on `<Callout>`).

- **Deployment did not update**  
  - Confirm that your changes were merged into the configured deployment branch.  
  - Verify that the latest commit triggered a build in your Documentation.AI project.

For deeper debugging, see the general [Troubleshoot build failures](/help/troubleshoot-build-failures) guide.

## Summary

Use the code editor workflow when you want Git-based, developer-friendly documentation:

- Write in `.mdx` using Documentation.AI components.
- Organize files to match navigation, and keep `documentation.json` in sync.
- Use branches, commits, and PRs to collaborate, with preview builds for each change.
- Let Documentation.AI handle builds and deployments from your main branch.

For teams that prefer WYSIWYG editing or non-Git workflows, pair this with the [Web Editor](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview) so both technical and non-technical contributors can work where they are most productive.
