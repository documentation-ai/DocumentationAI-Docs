# Code Editor Troubleshooting

Resolve common issues when working with Documentation.AI using code editors, Git workflows, and the publishing process.

## Build and Deployment Issues

### Documentation.AI Build Failures

**Issue**: Build fails after pushing changes

**Common causes**:
- Invalid `documentation.json` syntax
- Missing files referenced in navigation
- Malformed front matter in MDX files
- Broken internal links

**Solutions**:
1. **Check build logs** in Documentation.AI dashboard
2. **Validate JSON** using online validator or `cat documentation.json | jq .`
3. **Verify navigation paths** - ensure all referenced files exist
4. **Check front matter** format in all MDX files:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Page Title
   description: Page description
   ---
   ```

### Repository Connection Issues

**Issue**: Documentation.AI not detecting Git pushes

**Solutions**:
- Verify repository is correctly connected in dashboard
- Check branch configuration matches your default branch
- Ensure webhooks are properly configured
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting repository

## Content and Navigation Issues

### Missing Pages in Navigation

**Issue**: New pages don't appear in published documentation

**Solutions**:
1. **Add to `documentation.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "navigation": {
       "groups": [
         {
           "group": "API Reference",
           "pages": [
             {
               "title": "New Endpoint",
               "path": "api/new-endpoint"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify file exists** at correct path with `.mdx` extension
3. **Check for typos** in file paths (paths are case-sensitive)

### Broken Internal Links

**Issue**: Internal links return 404 errors

**Solutions**:
- Use relative paths: `[Link](../section/page)` not `[Link](/section/page.mdx)`
- Remove `.mdx` extension from links
- Verify target files exist in correct locations

## Image and Media Issues

### Images Not Displaying

**Issue**: Images show broken or don't load

**Solutions**:
1. **Use Documentation.AI CDN URLs**:
   ```mdx
   <Image 
     uid="generated-uid"
     src="https://cdn-url.com/image.png" 
     alt="Description"
   />
   ```

2. **Upload via web editor first** to get proper CDN URLs
3. **Check external URLs** are accessible and properly formatted
4. **Verify Image component syntax** matches Documentation.AI format

### Video Embedding Problems

**Issue**: Videos don't embed or play correctly

**Solutions**:
- Use Documentation.AI Video component syntax
- Verify external video URLs are embeddable
- Check video platform supports embedding (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

## Git and Sync Issues

### Merge Conflicts

**Issue**: Conflicts when merging branches, especially in `documentation.json`

**Solutions**:
1. **Use your editor's merge tools** - VS Code and Cursor have built-in conflict resolution
2. **Coordinate navigation changes** - Avoid multiple people editing `documentation.json` simultaneously
3. **Keep branches up to date** with main branch to reduce conflicts

### Changes Not Reflecting

**Issue**: Pushed changes don't appear in published documentation

**Solutions**:
1. **Check build status** in Documentation.AI dashboard
2. **Verify correct branch** is configured for deployment
3. **Wait for build completion** - builds may take a few minutes
4. **Clear browser cache** if changes appear to be cached

## Editor and Performance Issues

### Slow Editor Performance

**Issue**: Code editor running slowly with documentation project

**Solutions**:
- **Exclude unnecessary files** from search and file watching
- **Use workspace settings** to optimize for documentation editing
- **Close unused files** and limit open editor tabs
- **Disable heavy extensions** when working on documentation

### MDX Syntax Issues

**Issue**: MDX files showing syntax errors or not highlighting properly

**Solutions**:
1. **Install MDX extensions** for your editor
2. **Configure file associations**:
   ```json
   {
     "files.associations": {
       "*.mdx": "markdown"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Restart editor** after installing extensions

## Getting Help

### Debug Information to Collect

When reporting issues, include:

**System information**:
- Operating system and version
- Code editor and version (VS Code, Cursor)
- Git version

**Documentation.AI specific**:
- Project/repository name
- Build logs from dashboard
- Error messages (full text)
- Steps to reproduce the issue

**Files to check**:
- `documentation.json` configuration
- Front matter in problematic MDX files
- Recent Git commits that may have caused issues

## Common Solutions

### Quick Fixes

**Build failing**:
1. Check `documentation.json` for syntax errors
2. Verify all navigation paths reference existing files
3. Ensure front matter is properly formatted in all MDX files

**Page not appearing**:
1. Add page to `documentation.json` navigation
2. Check file path matches navigation configuration exactly
3. Verify file has proper front matter

**Images not loading**:
1. Use Documentation.AI CDN URLs from web editor uploads
2. Verify Image component syntax is correct
3. Check that external image URLs are accessible

### Emergency Rollback

If your site is broken:

```bash
# Quick rollback to previous working version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
