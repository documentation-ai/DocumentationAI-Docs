## Organize content and navigation in the Editor

This guide shows how to build a clean, scalable documentation structure using the **Editor view**. You’ll learn how to design navigation (dimensions, tabs, dropdowns), add pages and API references, and organize content using groups and nested page containers.

It is written for documentation editors working inside a project in the web Editor.

### Who this is for

- Documentation editors who create and maintain topic hierarchies, landing pages, and collections.

- Contributors who need a repeatable approach to naming, grouping, and publishing content.

### Prerequisites

- Editor access to your documentation project.

- Basic familiarity with creating and editing pages. See the Overview for Editor basics: [Overview](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview).

- If you plan to generate API docs, have an OpenAPI JSON or YAML file ready.

## Concepts you need to know

### Dimensions

Dimensions are top-level “context selectors” that split your docs into parallel variants.

Use dimensions when navigation changes based on:

- Product (Product A, Product B)

- Version (v1, v2)

- Language (English, Español)

In the published docs, dimensions usually appear as dropdown selectors near the top of the site.

### Views

Views define how navigation is presented inside a context.

In this system, the supported view types are

- **Tabs**: top-level navigation sections (Guides, API Reference)

- **Dropdowns**: collapsible sidebar categories (Guides, API References, Integrations)

### Content items

These are the clickable navigation entries:

- **Group**: a labeled sidebar section that contains pages (Getting Started, Core Features)

- **Page**: a normal documentation page

- **Page Group**: a nested container of pages (like a folder in the sidebar)

- **OpenAPI Reference**: generated API pages from a spec file

- **Unpublished Page**: an existing page that is not currently in navigation

### The one-child rule (why the UI hides options)

Each container can contain **exactly one child type**.

For example:

- a tab can contain **pages** *or* **groups** *or* **dropdowns**

- a dropdown can contain **pages** *or* **groups** *or* **tabs** *or* **dropdowns**

This is why the Editor only shows valid “Add …” options at each level.

## Quick workflow (summary)

1. Decide whether you need dimensions (Product/Version/Language).

2. Choose a navigation style:

   - Tabs for major sections, dropdowns for sidebar categories.

3. Build structure using **parent/child layers** (the Editor moves content for you).

4. Add content using Pages, Page Groups, OpenAPI References, and Unpublished Pages.

5. Add **Groups** if the sidebar becomes long or needs clear sectioning.

6. Reorder and refine using Move actions and incremental layering.

## Create navigation structure (step-by-step)

### How layering works in the Editor

You can add structure in two ways:

- **Add Parent layer (top&#x20;**<kbd>+</kbd>**)**\
  Adds a new layer *above* the current one and moves your existing content under it.

- **Add Child layer (bottom&#x20;**<kbd>+</kbd>**&#x20;/ inline add)**\
  Adds a layer *inside the selected item only*. Siblings are unchanged.

A good rule:

- Use **Parent** when you want to change the structure for “everything here.”

- Use **Child** when you want to change the structure for “only this section.”

<Steps>
  <Step title="Decide if you need dimensions" title-type="p">
    Use no dimensions for simple sites where everyone sees the same navigation.

    - Add **Version** if your docs differ across releases (v1, v2).&#x20;

    - Add **Product** if you maintain separate docs for multiple offerings.&#x20;

    - Add **Language** if you publish localized navigation/content.

    Keep it simple: 1–2 dimensions is usually enough for most sites.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a dimension layer (optional)" title-type="p">
    1. In the Navigation panel, click the top <kbd>+</kbd> (Add Parent).

    2. Choose Add Product, Add Version, or Add Language.

    3. Create your first value (for example, v1.0).

    What happens: your current navigation becomes the branch for that value.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tabs for major sections" title-type="p">
    Tabs work well when your docs have parallel top-level areas like

    - Guides

    - API Reference

    - Tutorials

    - Changelog

    1. Navigate to the branch you want to edit (for example, Version: v1.0).

    2. Add Tabs (as parent or child depending on your current structure).

    3. Create tab names (for example, Guides, API Reference).

    <Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-53a37986-2c9e-4094-b9e8-1e1ffae9e9ee/doc-b389b141-ae58-4fd5-91f9-6702fae9ac58/1765804752144-4msvh4016t6-pasted-image-1765804750354.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="400" height="359" alt="" style="width: 400px; height: auto; cursor: pointer;" />

    <Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
      Keep tab names consistent across versions/products to reduce user confusion.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dropdowns for sidebar categories" title-type="p">
    Dropdowns work well when your sidebar needs hierarchy.

    1. Select the tab (or dimension branch) where you want categories.

    2. Use Add Child to add a dropdown layer inside that tab, or use Add Parent if you want dropdowns to wrap everything.

    3. Create dropdown items (for example `Getting Started`, `Core Features`, `Integrations`).

    What happens: existing content is moved under the new dropdown item if you added it as a wrapper.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate the structure by switching selectors" title-type="p">
    Switch between:

    - versions/products/languages (if present)

    - tabs

    - dropdown items

    This confirms you’re editing the correct branch and that content is placed where you expect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organize content (Pages, Page Groups, OpenAPI)

You add content inside the currently selected branch (for example: Version: v1.0 → Tab: Guides → Dropdown: Core Features).

### Pages menu (default state)

In the sidebar, you’ll see Pages and a + icon. Clicking + shows:

- Add Page

- Add Group

- Add Page Group

- Add OpenAPI Reference

- Add Unpublished Page

### Add a Page

A Page is a standard navigation entry.

1. Click **Pages → +**

2. Select **Add Page**

3. Fill in:

   - Page name

   - Page URL (slug) — **must be unique**

   - Icon (optional)

URL note: enter only the slug (no full URL). Use consistent kebab-case.

### Create nested navigation using Page Groups

Use Page Groups when you want nested pages under a single sidebar item.

1. Click **Pages → +**

2. Select **Add Page Group**

3. Set name + optional icon

4. Expand the Page Group and use its **+** to add:

   - Pages

   - Page Groups (nested)

   - OpenAPI References

   - Unpublished Pages

This is ideal for structures like SDKs, integrations, or multi-step tutorials.

### Generate API docs using OpenAPI Reference

1. Click **Pages → +**

2. Select **Add OpenAPI Reference**

3. Upload an OpenAPI JSON/YAML file or paste the spec content

The Editor generates the API pages automatically and adds them to navigation.

### Re-add removed pages using Unpublished Pages

Unpublished Pages are pages that exist but are not currently in navigation.

1. Click **Pages → +**

2. Select **Add Unpublished Page**

3. Choose the page to restore

Use this for drafts, temporarily hidden docs, or restoring older content.

## Step-by-step: organize with Groups&#x20;

Groups create clear sidebar sections like “Getting Started” and “Core Features”.

### What changes when you add Groups

Once Groups exist at a level:

- The sidebar heading changes from **Pages** to **Groups**

- You add new sections using **Groups&#x20;**

- You add content inside a **Group**

Also, at a given level you should keep navigation consistent:

- either keep items as ungrouped Pages, or

- organize them inside Groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Group" icon="CirclePlus" title-type="p">
    1. Click on the <kbd>+</kbd> icon next to the heading **"Pages"** and choose **Add Group** (first time), or click on the <kbd>+</kbd> icon next to the heading "**Groups"** if group(s) are already enabled/created.

    2. Enter: Group name, and Icon (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add content inside a Group" icon="FilesIcon" title-type="p">
    1. Find the group in the sidebar and click on the <kbd>+</kbd> icon beside the respective group name in the sidebar.&#x20;

    2. **Add**: Page, Page Group, OpenAPI Reference, Unpublished Page

    A group can contain a mix of these items.&#x20;
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit and move Groups" icon="FolderInput" title-type="p">
    Each group has a <kbd>...</kbd>**&#x20;(three-dot)** menu.

    Use it to:

    - Edit group name/icon

    - **Move** the group anywhere in your documentation

    Move is the safest way to reorganize large sections without rebuilding pages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="danger" collapsed="false">
  Avoid mixing grouped and ungrouped content at the same level. Pick one approach per branch.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple docs (no dimensions)

- Tabs: Guides, API Reference

- Groups under Guides: Getting Started, Core Features

- OpenAPI Reference under API Reference

Good for: single product, no versioning.

### Example 2: Versioned docs

- Version selector: v1.0, v2.0

- Under each version:

  - Tabs: Guides, API Reference

  - Dropdowns: Guides → (Core, Integrations)

  - Groups inside dropdowns

Good for: APIs that differ across versions.

### Example 3: Hierarchical sidebar without tabs

- Dropdowns only: Platform → Integrations → (pages)

- Page Groups for deep nesting

Good for: docs that are primarily category-driven.

## Best practices

### Keep structure shallow and predictable

- Prefer 2–3 levels of nesting for most sites.

- Use dropdowns for hierarchy, but avoid “dropdown inside dropdown inside dropdown” unless necessary.

### Use the right tool for the job

- Tabs: major parallel sections (Guides vs API)

- Dropdowns: sidebar categories

- Groups: clear sections inside a branch

- Page Groups: nested items inside a section

### Be consistent across contexts

If you use Products/Versions/Languages:

- keep tab names and top-level dropdowns consistent across branches

- only diverge where content truly differs

### Treat slugs as stable identifiers

- use kebab-case

- keep slugs unchanged after publishing

- rename page titles freely, but change URLs cautiously

### Restructure by layering, not rebuilding

- Add Parent layer to wrap and migrate everything safely

- Add Child layer to deepen one section without affecting others

## Editor tips and warnings

- Start with a minimal structure and let it grow. It’s easier to wrap content into new layers later than to predict every category upfront.

- Use Page Groups for deep nesting within a section, and Groups for broad sidebar sections.

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  Don’t overuse dimensions. Too many context selectors make navigation hard to reason about and harder to maintain.
