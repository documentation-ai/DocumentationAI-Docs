title: Organize content and navigation in Editor view

## Introduction

This guide shows how to design and maintain your site's navigation structure from the Editor view. It explains the Editor's navigation model, walks through creating groups and pages, and provides detailed, actionable steps you can follow right away.

The Editor UI uses a layered model — dimensions, views, and content — and each container accepts a single child type. Keep that model in mind when you create groups and pages so your navigation remains consistent and predictable.

## Navigation model

The site navigation is organized as a three-level hierarchy:

- Tabs — top-level areas such as "Documentation", "Changelog", and "Help".
- Groups — collections inside a tab used to organize related pages or subgroups.
- Pages — individual documentation pages inside groups.

Common behaviors

- Groups can be expandable or collapsed to control visibility.
- A group can contain pages and, in some cases, nested groups (subgroups).
- One child type rule: each container accepts one type of child (for example, a group that holds pages should not mix page-like objects with unrelated child types).

See the Editor overview for visual orientation: [Web editor overview](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview).

When you add or reorder items in the Editor, the change affects the live navigation once you publish those edits. Work in small, reviewable batches.

## Creating a navigation structure (high level)

Before you start, confirm you have Editor permissions and an agreed sitemap or outline for your content.

1. Decide top-level tabs and which content belongs in each tab.
2. Create groups to surface major sections (for example, "Getting Started", "API Reference").
3. Add pages to groups and optionally create subgroups for long sections.
4. Reorder and mark groups as expandable to control sidebar behavior.
5. Preview and publish changes.

If you need help configuring sidebar appearance beyond structure, see: [Navigation & sidebar](/customization-and-configuration/navigation-and-sidebar).

## Creating content (pages)

When you create a page in the Editor:

- Title the page clearly and write concise, scannable headings.
- Use one primary purpose per page (single responsibility).
- Use components (cards, images, code groups) to structure content visually.
- Keep filenames and paths descriptive and stable to avoid broken links.

Quick checklist before saving a new page:

- Page title set and matches the URL slug.
- Page placed in the intended group.
- Content uses the Editor components consistently.
- Any images or media include descriptive alt text.

## Creating groups and subgroups

Use groups to organize navigation and to control sidebar density.

- Create groups for major subject areas (for example, "Write and Publish").
- Make long lists collapsible by setting the group to expandable.
- Use subgroups for technical distinctions (for example, split "Web Editor" and "Code Editor" into separate subgroups).
- Assign icons to groups for quicker scanning in the sidebar.

Keep group depth shallow where possible — two to three levels (tab → group → page or subgroup → page) helps readers navigate quickly.

## Detailed step instructions

### Add a new top-level page

1. Open Editor view and navigate to the tab and group where you want the page.
2. Click the "New page" or "Add" button in the group toolbar.
3. Enter a descriptive page title; confirm or edit the generated slug.
4. Add content using the Editor components (headings, lists, code blocks, images).
5. Save the draft and preview the page in the site preview pane.
6. When ready, publish the page so it becomes visible in the live navigation.

### Move a page into a different group

1. In Editor view, open the sidebar where your pages and groups are listed.
2. Drag the page item into the target group, or use the page's context menu and select "Move".
3. Confirm the new path and update any internal links if the slug changed.
4. Save and publish the change.

### Create a subgroup

1. Open the group that will contain the subgroup.
2. Click "Add subgroup" or "New group" in the group controls.
3. Give the subgroup a name and choose whether it should be expandable.
4. Add or move pages into the subgroup.
5. Save and publish.

### Reorder navigation items

1. Drag and drop tabs, groups, and pages in the Editor sidebar to reorder them.
2. For large reorganization, record the intended outline in a separate document to reduce mistakes.
3. Save and publish incremental changes rather than reordering an entire site in one step.

### Set a group to expandable (collapse/expand)

1. Select the group in the Editor.
2. Toggle the "Expandable" or "Collapsible" option in the group settings.
3. Save; the sidebar will show a disclosure chevron for that group when published.

If you expect frequent changes in a section, keep that group collapsed by default and surface only the most important pages as direct children to reduce clutter.

## Best practices

- Names and labels: Use short, descriptive page and group titles. Keep naming consistent across the site.
- Shallow navigation: Prefer a shallow hierarchy (2–3 levels) so readers can reach content in 2–4 clicks.
- One purpose per page: Avoid mixing multiple topics on a single page; create focused pages that are easier to link and maintain.
- Reuse patterns: Use shared components and templates for similar pages to maintain consistency.
- Icons and affordances: Use icons selectively to help scanning but avoid relying on them for critical information.
- Preserve slugs: Avoid renaming published slugs. If you must change a slug, add redirects and update internal links.
- Review and publish small batches: Make small, reviewable changes and publish frequently so changes are easy to test and revert if needed.
- Accessibility: Add alt text to images and use semantic headings for screen readers.

## Troubleshooting and resources

- If you can't find the group or page you expect, check whether it is collapsed or nested as a subgroup.

<ExpandableGroup>

<Expandable title="Why one child type per container matters" default-open="false">

When a container accepts only one child type, the Editor enforces predictable structure and avoids mixed content that would break the navigation model. For example, a group intended to hold pages should not be mixed with a different object type that the rendering engine treats differently.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Common mistakes to avoid" default-open="false">

- Placing many unrelated pages into a single group.
- Using long page titles that create unwieldy slugs.
- Reordering large portions of navigation without testing links.
