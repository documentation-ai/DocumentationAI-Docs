## Organize content and navigation in the Editor

This guide shows how to build a clean, scalable documentation structure using the **Editor view**. You’ll learn how to design navigation (dimensions, tabs, dropdowns), add pages and API references, and organize content using groups and nested page containers.

It is written for documentation editors working inside a project in the web Editor.

### Who this is for

- Documentation editors who create and maintain topic hierarchies, landing pages, and collections.

- Contributors who need a repeatable approach to naming, grouping, and publishing content.

### Prerequisites

- Editor access to your documentation project.

- Basic familiarity with creating and editing pages. See the Overview for Editor basics: [Overview](/write-and-publish/web-editor/overview).

- If you plan to generate API docs, have an OpenAPI JSON or YAML file ready.

## Concepts you need to know

### Dimensions

Dimensions are top-level “context selectors” that split your docs into parallel variants.

Use dimensions when navigation changes based on:

- Product (Product A, Product B)

- Version (v1, v2)

- Language (English, Español)

In the published docs, dimensions usually appear as dropdown selectors near the top of the site.

### Views

Views define how navigation is presented inside a context.

In this system, the supported view types are

- **Tabs**: top-level navigation sections (Guides, API Reference)

- **Dropdowns**: collapsible sidebar categories (Guides, API References, Integrations)

### Content items

These are the clickable navigation entries:

- **Group**: a labeled sidebar section that contains pages (Getting Started, Core Features)

- **Page**: a normal documentation page

- **Page Group**: a nested container of pages (like a folder in the sidebar)

- **OpenAPI Reference**: generated API pages from a spec file

- **Unpublished Page**: an existing page that is not currently in navigation

### The one-child rule (why the UI hides options)

Each container can contain **exactly one child type**.

For example:

- a tab can contain **pages** *or* **groups** *or* **dropdowns**

- a dropdown can contain **pages** *or* **groups** *or* **tabs** *or* **dropdowns**

This is why the Editor only shows valid “Add …” options at each level.

## Quick workflow (summary)

1. Decide whether you need dimensions (Product/Version/Language).

2. Choose a navigation style:

   - Tabs for major sections, dropdowns for sidebar categories.

3. Build structure using **parent/child layers** (the Editor moves content for you).

4. Add content using Pages, Page Groups, OpenAPI References, and Unpublished Pages.

5. Add **Groups** if the sidebar becomes long or needs clear sectioning.

6. Reorder and refine using Move actions and incremental layering.

## Step-by-step: create navigation structure

### How layering works in the Editor

You can add structure in two ways:

- **Add Parent layer (top&#x20;**<kbd>+</kbd>**)**\
  Adds a new layer *above* the current one and moves your existing content under it.

- **Add Child layer (bottom&#x20;**<kbd>+</kbd>**&#x20;/ inline add)**\
  Adds a layer *inside the selected item only*. Siblings are unchanged.

A good rule:

- Use **Parent** when you want to change the structure for “everything here.”

- Use **Child** when you want to change the structure for “only this section.”

<Steps>
  <Step title="Decide if you need dimensions" title-type="p">
    Use no dimensions for simple sites where everyone sees the same navigation.

    - Add **Version** if your docs differ across releases (v1, v2).&#x20;

    - Add **Product&#x20;**&#x69;f you maintain separate docs for multiple offerings.&#x20;

    - Add Language if you publish localized navigation/content.

    Keep it simple: 1–2 dimensions is usually enough for most sites.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a dimension layer (optional)" title-type="p">
    1. In the Navigation panel, click the top <kbd>+</kbd> (Add Parent).

    2. Choose Add Product, Add Version, or Add Language.

    3. Create your first value (for example, v1.0).

    What happens: your current navigation becomes the branch for that value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tabs for major sections" title-type="p">
    Tabs work well when your docs have parallel top-level areas like:

    - Guides

    - API Reference

    - Tutorials

    - Changelog

    1. Navigate to the branch you want to edit (for example Version: v1.0).

    2. Add Tabs (as parent or child depending on your current structure).

    3. Create tab names (for example Guides, API Reference).

    <Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
      Keep tab names consistent across versions/products to reduce user confusion.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dropdowns for sidebar categories" title-type="p">
    Dropdowns work well when your sidebar needs hierarchy.

    1. Select the tab (or dimension branch) where you want categories.

    2. Use Add Child to add a dropdown layer inside that tab, or use Add Parent if you want dropdowns to wrap everything.

    3. Create dropdown items (for example `Getting Started`, `Core Features`, `Integrations`).

    What happens: existing content is moved under the new dropdown item if you added it as a wrapper.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate the structure by switching selectors" title-type="p">
    Switch between:

    - versions/products/languages (if present)

    - tabs

    - dropdown items

    This confirms you’re editing the correct branch and that content is placed where you expect.
  </Step>
