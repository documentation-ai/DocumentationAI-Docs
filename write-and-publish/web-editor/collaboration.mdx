## Images

There are multiple ways to upload imageÂ 

- By typing /image in the editor and you will see already uploaded image and images. You will also see an option to upload image if required.&#x20;

- You can also upload image by copy pasting.&#x20;

### File Size.

The maximum file size that we allow at this point is 20 MB. If there is a requirement to meet.&#x20;



For images, for best page speed insights, try to keep each size to 100-200KB. We also do dynamic image optimization at our end, but having the base file in the minimum size helps.&#x20;

## Video and Embed

Video are supported via iframes. You can uploade videos to youtube or loom

  As of now, the only way you can see all your media is via / command in the editor. We will soon provide an option to upload and manage all the media outside the editor as well.&#x20;
