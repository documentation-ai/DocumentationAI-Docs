description: Learn how to write and manage documentation using the web editor in Documentation.AI
---


The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and managing documentation directly in your browser. No local setup required - start writing immediately from your dashboard.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Visual editing**: Make changes using a WYSIWYG editor that shows how your content will look when published
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple team members can work simultaneously on the same content
- **Auto-save and sync**: Changes are automatically saved and synced across your team
- **Component integration**: Add callouts, code blocks, and other components using slash commands
- **Dual editing modes**: Switch between visual and markdown modes based on your preference

## Web Editor Workflow

Here's how you'll typically work in the web editor:

### 1. Access Your Project

Navigate to your Documentation.AI dashboard and select your project. Click `Web Editor` to enter the editing interface.

### 2. Navigate to Your Content

Use the file explorer sidebar to:
- Open an existing page for editing
- Create a new page by clicking the `+` button
- Browse through your documentation structure
- Search for specific pages using the search function

### 3. Choose Your Editing Mode

Switch between editing modes using the toggle in the editor toolbar:
- **Visual mode**: For WYSIWYG editing with immediate preview
- **Markdown mode**: For direct MDX code editing

### 4. Create and Edit Content

**In Visual Mode:**
- Type content directly and see real-time formatting
- Press `/` to open the component menu
- Select from available blocks: headings, lists, callouts, code blocks, images
- Drag and drop to reorganize content blocks
- Use the formatting toolbar for text styling

**In Markdown Mode:**
- Write directly in MDX syntax
- Access Documentation.AI components using JSX syntax
- Add custom HTML when needed
- View syntax highlighting for better readability

### 5. Preview Your Changes

Visual mode shows you exactly how your content will appear on your published site. Use this to:
- Verify formatting and layout
- Check component rendering
- Ensure images and media display correctly
- Test responsive behavior

### 6. Save and Publish

Your changes are automatically saved as you type. When ready to publish:
- Review your content in preview mode
- Click `Publish` to deploy changes to your live documentation
- View your published page to confirm everything looks correct

## Editor Modes

Use the toggle in the editor toolbar to switch between editing modes:

### Visual Mode

Visual mode provides a WYSIWYG editing experience where changes you make in the editor are exactly what will appear on your published documentation site.

**Working in Visual Mode:**
- Type content directly and see immediate formatting
- Press `/` to open the component menu
- Select from available blocks: headings, lists, callouts, code blocks, images
- Drag and drop to reorganize content blocks
- Use the formatting toolbar for text styling
- See live preview of how components will render

**Best for**: Content creators, writers, and anyone who prefers seeing immediate visual results.

### Markdown Mode

Markdown mode provides direct access to the underlying MDX code of your documentation. This mode is ideal when you need precise control over component properties.

**Working in Markdown Mode:**
- Write using standard markdown syntax
- Access Documentation.AI components with JSX syntax:
  ```jsx
  <Callout type="info">
    This is an info callout
  </Callout>
  ```
- Add custom HTML when needed for advanced formatting
- Edit component properties directly
- View syntax highlighting for better code readability
- Copy and paste markdown content from other sources

**Best for**: Developers, technical writers, and users who need precise control over component properties.
