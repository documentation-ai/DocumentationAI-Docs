The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and managing documentation directly in your browser. You do not need Git access or local tooling, so you can start writing from your dashboard immediately.

## What the web editor is and when to use it

The web editor gives you:

- A WYSIWYG experience for fast editing

- Real-time collaboration with your team

- Automatic saving and version-safe publishing

- Easy access to Documentation.AI components through slash commands

Use the web editor when:

- You want to write or update docs without touching Git or your local environment.

- Multiple teammates (product, engineering, support) contribute to documentation.

- You prefer a visual authoring experience with live preview.

- You are iterating on content structure and layout directly in the browser.

If you need a Git-based workflow, local previews, or tight integration with your existing development tooling, use the [code editor](/write-and-publish/code-editor/overview) instead.

## Understanding the documentation navigation

### Navigation hierarchy in the web editor

When you open a project in the web editor, your content follows a consistent hierarchy:

- **Dimension → View → Groups → Pages**

This hierarchy controls both what you see in the sidebar and which pages you are editing.

### Dimensions: top-level documentation spaces

**Dimensions** define the top-level organization of your docs for different audiences or use cases (for example, end users vs. API consumers).

- Each Dimension is a separate documentation space with its own structure.
- Switching Dimensions changes the entire documentation tree you are working in.

Learn more in the [Dimensions reference](/organize/dimensions).

### Views: filtered perspectives within a Dimension

Within a Dimension, **Views** are the selectable perspectives that determine which groups and pages appear in the sidebar.

- Each View can show a different subset or arrangement of the same underlying content.
- Switching Views changes which groups and pages are visible and editable, without leaving the current Dimension.

See the [Views reference](/organize/views) for configuration details.

### Sidebar layout: tabs, groups, and pages

Once you have chosen a Dimension and View, the left sidebar in the web editor typically shows:

- **Top-level tabs** such as Documentation, Changelog, and Help.
- **Groups or sections** (for example, Getting Started, Write and Publish, Organize) that act as folders for related content.
- **Pages** inside each group (for example, Web Editor, Code Editor, Pages) that you can open and edit.

This layout lets you move between different parts of your docs while staying in the same editor session.

### What you can do from the sidebar

From the web editor sidebar you can:

- Click a group to reveal all pages inside it.
- Select a page to load it in the editor.
- Use search to jump directly to a page by title or content.

Your writing always applies to the page that is currently selected in the sidebar. To go deeper into how pages themselves work (titles, slugs, paths, and metadata), see [Pages in the Organize section](/organize/pages).

## Getting started with the web editor

### 1. Open your project

1. Sign in to Documentation.AI.

2. From the dashboard, select the project you want to edit.

3. Open the project workspace.

### 2. Launch the web editor

From the project workspace:

1. Go to the documentation area or page list.

2. Select a page to edit, or create a new page.

3. Choose the web editor if you are prompted to pick an editing mode.

The editor opens with your content and shows the current mode (visual or markdown) in the toolbar.

### 3. Navigate your content

Use the sidebar to:

- Browse the documentation tree.

- Open existing pages for editing.

- Create new pages or groups.

- Search for specific pages by title or content.

Changes you make in the editor apply to the currently selected page.

For a deeper look at how groups and pages work across your project, see the high-level [organize overview](/organize/overview) and the detailed [Pages guide in Organize](/organize/pages).

## Writing content

You can write in two modes:

- **Visual mode**: Block-based WYSIWYG editing.

- **Markdown mode**: Direct MDX editing with full control over components.

Use the mode toggle in the editor toolbar to switch at any time.

### Visual mode

Visual mode shows your content as it will appear on your published site. You work with blocks instead of raw syntax.

**In visual mode you can:**

- Type content directly and see formatting as you go.

- Use the toolbar to apply headings, bold, italics, links, and inline code.

- Press `/` to insert blocks and components.

- Drag and drop blocks to reorder content.

- See components rendered as they will look when published.

### Markdown mode

Markdown mode exposes the underlying MDX source for your page so you can work directly with syntax and component props.

**In markdown mode you can:**

- Write with standard markdown for headings, lists, and links.

- Use Documentation.AI components with JSX syntax:

```tsx
<Callout kind="info">
  Use callouts to highlight important information for your readers.
</Callout>
```

- Edit component properties and nesting precisely.

- Add custom HTML when needed for advanced layouts.

- Copy and paste content from other markdown sources.

### Headings, links, and structure

Use headings and links to keep your documentation easy to scan:

- Use a single top-level page title in frontmatter, then start content with `##` headings.

- Create a clear outline with `##` and `###` sections.

- Use descriptive link text (for example, `[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)` instead of “click here”).

- Break long pages into logical sections instead of one large block of text.

In visual mode, you can set heading levels using the toolbar. In markdown mode, use `##`, `###`, and so on.

## Adding rich content

The web editor makes it easy to add code samples, callouts, images, and other documentation components.

### Using slash commands

Type `/` in an empty line or at the start of a block to open the component menu.

From the menu you can quickly insert:

- Basic content: text, headings, lists, dividers

- Rich content: code blocks, images, tables, quotes

- Documentation.AI components: callouts, cards, steps, tabs, expandables, and more

You can always adjust block type, position, and properties after inserting.

### Code blocks and technical content

Use code blocks for examples and snippets:

- Insert a code block via `/code`.

- Choose a language for syntax highlighting (for example, `bash`, `ts`, `python`).

- Keep examples focused and copy-pasteable.

For more advanced scenarios, you can use the code and API components described in the components section of the docs:

- [Code blocks and groups](/components/code-blocks-and-groups)

- [API components](/components/api-components)

### Callouts and guidance

Use callouts to highlight important information, warnings, or tips.

In markdown mode:

```tsx
<Callout kind="tip">
  Use callouts to emphasize best practices or caveats that readers should not miss.
</Callout>
```

In visual mode:

- Type `/callout` and pick the style (info, tip, success, alert, danger).

- Edit the text directly in the rendered block.

### Images and media

You can add screenshots, diagrams, and media directly from the web editor:

- Insert an image via `/image` and upload a file or paste a URL.

- Provide clear alt text so content remains accessible.

- Resize or reposition images using the visual controls when available.

For videos or interactive content, use `/video` or `/iframe` (depending on your configuration) to embed external media.

To learn more about the underlying components, see:

- [Images](/components/images)

- [Videos and iframes](/components/videos-and-iframes)

## Organizing and reviewing content

As this page becomes the main entry point for the web editor, you will often use it alongside the project organization features.

### Moving and organizing pages

Use the sidebar to adjust your documentation structure:

- Create new groups or sections for related pages.

- Move pages into different groups to keep navigation intuitive.

- Rename pages and update slugs where needed.

For a deeper look at how groups and pages work across your project, see the high-level [organize overview](/organize/overview) and the focused guide on [organizing pages](/organize/pages).

### Collaboration and review

The web editor is built for teams:

- Multiple collaborators can open and edit content.

- Changes are auto-saved as you type.

- You can review edits in the editor before publishing.

Use your team’s review process (for example, checklists, issue trackers, or comments in your existing tools) around the web editor to keep changes controlled and traceable.

## Publishing workflow

The web editor separates editing from publishing so you can work safely before sending changes live.

A typical loop:

1. **Edit**\
   Open a page in the web editor, make changes in visual or markdown mode, and ensure the structure looks correct.

2. **Review in the editor**

   - Scan headings and navigation.

   - Confirm code blocks, callouts, and components render correctly.

   - Check images and embeds.

3. **Publish**\
   When you are satisfied with the page:

   - Use the publish action in your project to deploy changes.

   - Wait for the publish process to complete.

4. **Verify on the live site**\
   Open the updated page on your documentation site:

   - Confirm layout and content match what you saw in the editor.

   - Test any links or interactive elements.

You can repeat this cycle as often as needed. For teams that require code review, or if you prefer a Git-based pipeline, use the [code editor overview](/write-and-publish/code-editor/overview) to understand the alternative publishing flow.
