## Best Practices

### When to Use Callouts

✅ **Good uses:**
- Highlighting important warnings or cautions
- Providing helpful tips and best practices
- Drawing attention to critical information
- Offering additional context or explanations

❌ **Avoid using callouts for:**
- Regular content that should be in the main flow
- Excessive highlighting (too many callouts reduce their impact)
- Non-critical information that doesn't need emphasis

### Content Guidelines

1. **Keep it concise**: Callouts should be brief and to the point
2. **Use appropriate types**: Match the callout type to the content severity
3. **Provide context**: Explain why the information is important
4. **Use clear language**: Write in plain, understandable terms

### Visual Design

- Use callouts sparingly to maintain their impact
- Don't nest callouts inside other callouts
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
