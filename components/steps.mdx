## Overview

The `<Steps>` component creates visually connected step-by-step instructions with automatic numbering, custom icons, and gradient connecting lines. Each step includes a title, optional icon, and rich content support.

Common use cases:
- Installation and setup guides with sequential instructions
- Multi-step tutorials and onboarding flows
- Process documentation showing workflow stages
- Configuration guides with ordered steps
- Migration or upgrade procedures

````jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="download">
    Run the installation command to add required packages to your project.
    
    ```bash
    npm install documentation-ai
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings" icon="settings">
    Create a configuration file in your project root with your API credentials.
    
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      apiKey: process.env.DOC_AI_KEY
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy documentation" icon="rocket">
    Push your changes and deploy to production.
    
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
````

  <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="download">
    Run the installation command to add required packages to your project.
    
    ```bash
    npm install documentation-ai
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings" icon="settings">

  <Step title="Deploy documentation" icon="rocket">
    Push your changes and deploy to production.
    
    ```bash

    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic syntax

Use the `<Steps>` component as a container with individual `<Step>` components for each instruction:

````jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First step" icon="circle-check">
    Description and content for the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second step" icon="circle-check">
    Description and content for the second step.
  </Step>
</Steps>
````

<Steps>
  <Step title="First step" icon="circle-check">
    Description and content for the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second step" icon="circle-check">
    Description and content for the second step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic numbering

Omit the `icon` attribute to display automatic sequential numbering:

````jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up with your email address and create a secure password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your email">
    Check your inbox for the verification link and click to confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete your profile">
    Add your organization details and team information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">
    Create your first documentation project and invite team members.
  </Step>
</Steps>
````

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up with your email address and create a secure password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your email">
    Check your inbox for the verification link and click to confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete your profile">
    Add your organization details and team information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">
    Create your first documentation project and invite team members.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Automatic numbering is ideal for sequential processes where order matters and each step builds on the previous one.
</Callout>

## Custom icons

Add visual context to each step using Lucide icons:

````jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone repository" icon="git-branch">
    Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/project.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install packages" icon="package">
    Install all project dependencies using your package manager.
    
    ```bash

## Attributes

### Steps component

The `<Steps>` component acts as a container and has no configurable attributes. It automatically manages step numbering and layout.

### Step component

<ParamField path="title" param-type="string" required="true" showLocation="false">
  The heading text displayed for this step. Serves as the main identifier for each instruction.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="icon" param-type="string" required="false" showLocation="false">
  Lucide icon name to display instead of automatic numbering. Omit this attribute to show sequential numbers. Reference [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for available options.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="titleType" param-type="string" required="false" showLocation="false">
  The HTML heading level for the step title. Accepts: `p`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, or `h6`. Default: `p`. Use heading levels to maintain proper document structure and improve accessibility.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="children" param-type="node" required="true" showLocation="false">
  The content of the step. Supports all MDX content including text, code blocks, callouts, lists, images, and other components.
</ParamField>

## Common patterns

- **Installation guides** - Use automatic numbering for clear sequential installation instructions where each step depends on the previous one being completed.
- **Configuration workflows** - Combine custom icons with rich content including code blocks and callouts to guide users through complex configuration processes.
- **Migration procedures** - Structure multi-phase migrations with heading levels (h2/h3) to create a clear hierarchy and improve document navigation.
- **Troubleshooting flows** - Use diagnostic icons (bug, alert-triangle, check-circle) to create visual troubleshooting guides that help users identify and resolve issues.
- **Onboarding sequences** - Create welcoming onboarding experiences with icons that represent each phase (user, settings, check, party-popper) and rich content explaining features.
- **API integration guides** - Document API integration steps with code examples, authentication setup, and testing procedures in a clear sequential format.
- **Deployment checklists** - Build pre-deployment checklists with nested callouts for warnings and success criteria, ensuring teams follow best practices.
- **Feature tutorials** - Break down complex features into digestible steps with screenshots, code samples, and explanations that users can follow at their own pace.
