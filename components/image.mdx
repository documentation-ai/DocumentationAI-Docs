## Image Formats

Supported image formats:

- **PNG** - Best for screenshots and images with transparency
- **JPEG/JPG** - Best for photographs and complex images
- **SVG** - Best for diagrams, icons, and scalable graphics
- **WebP** - Modern format with excellent compression
- **GIF** - For simple animations (use sparingly)

## Accessibility Features

- **Alt Text**: Required for all images to describe content for screen readers
- **Semantic Markup**: Uses proper HTML image elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Images are focusable when interactive
- **High Contrast**: Works with high contrast mode and themes
- **Screen Reader Support**: Provides meaningful descriptions

## Performance Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when they enter the viewport
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically scales based on container size
- **Format Optimization**: Serves appropriate format based on browser support
- **Caching**: Implements proper caching headers for performance

## Best Practices

- Always provide meaningful alt text that describes the image content
- Use appropriate image formats for the content type
- Optimize image file sizes for web delivery
- Include captions for complex diagrams or screenshots
- Ensure images are readable at different screen sizes
- Use consistent styling and sizing throughout documentation

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Alt text should describe the image content, not just say "image" or "screenshot"
- For decorative images, use empty alt text (`alt=""`)
- For complex images like charts, provide detailed descriptions in the caption or surrounding text
- Ensure sufficient color contrast in images with text
- Test images with screen readers and keyboard navigation
