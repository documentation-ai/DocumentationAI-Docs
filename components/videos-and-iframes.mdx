  Reference for embedding videos and iframes using the editor UI and the Video /
  Iframe components.

## Overview

Use videos and iframes to embed rich, interactive content directly in your docs, such as:

- Product walkthroughs and demos (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom)
- Self-hosted video files (MP4, WebM, OGG)
- External tools and dashboards (forms, analytics, sandboxes)

In Documentation.AI you can:

- Use the **Web Editor** to paste links or embed codes and adjust layout visually.
- Use the **Code Editor** to write `<Video>` and `<Iframe>` components in MDX for full control.

For static images, see [Images](/components/images). For showing embed code examples (such as iframe snippets) as code instead of rendering them, use [Code and Groups](/components/code-blocks-and-groups).

## Using with Web Editor

### Insert a video or iframe

1. Place your cursor on a new line in the Web Editor.
2. Type <kbd>/</kbd> and select **Video**.
3. In the **Video URL or Embed Code** dialog, paste either:
   - A **video URL** (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, MP4 URL, etc.), or
   - An `iframe` **embed code** copied from another tool.
4. Click **Insert Video**. The video or iframe appears in your document.

You can use the same block for both direct video URLs and iframe-based embeds from other platforms.

Prefer writing in code?

You can switch to **MDX view inside the Web Editor** to write or edit this component using the same syntax as the Code Editor. This is useful if you want full control while staying in the Web Editor.

### Align and resize

Hover over the embedded video or iframe to reveal controls:

- **Top-right toolbar**
  - **Alignment icon:** Change alignment (for example, left, center, or right), similar to images.
  - **Other actions:** May include zoom or delete, depending on your configuration.
- **Side drag handles**
  - Drag the **left** or **right** handle to adjust the **width**.
  - The **height adjusts automatically** to keep the original aspect ratio for videos.

Use these controls to keep layouts consistent with nearby content and images.

## Using with Code Editor

In the Code Editor, you work directly in MDX using the `<Video>` and `<Iframe>` components.

### `<Video>` component (iframe mode)

Use iframe mode for platforms that provide an embed URL, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, or Wistia.

```tsx
<Video
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Reu01KxMSF0"
  title="Feature overview video"
  width="672"
  height="378"
  allow-full-screen="true"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 672px; height: auto;"
/>
```

Key props:

- `src` (string, required): Video embed URL from the platform.
- `width` / `height` (string): Player dimensions in pixels.
- `title` (string): Accessible title for screen readers.
- `allow-full-screen` (boolean-like): Allow fullscreen playback (defaults to `true`).
- `priority` (boolean-like): Load immediately instead of lazy loading.
- `style` (string): Inline styles for alignment and sizing.

### `<Video>` component (HTML5 mode)

Use HTML5 mode for self-hosted video files, with native browser controls.

```tsx
<Video
  src="https://example.com/video/feature-walkthrough.mp4"
  width="672"
  height="378"
  controls="true"
  poster="https://example.com/video/feature-walkthrough-poster.jpg"
  preload="metadata"
  fetchPriority="high"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 672px; height: auto;"
/>
```

Additional props for HTML5 playback:

- `controls` (boolean-like): Show video controls (defaults to `true`).
- `autoplay` (boolean-like): Start playing when the page loads.
- `muted` (boolean-like): Start muted (often required for autoplay).
- `loop` (boolean-like): Loop playback.
- `poster` (string): Poster image shown before playback.
- `preload` (string): `none`, `metadata`, or `auto`.
- `fetchPriority` (string): `high`, `low`, or `auto`.

### `<Iframe>` component

Use `<Iframe>` for non-video embeds such as forms, dashboards, and interactive tools.

```tsx
<Iframe
  src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexample/viewform"
  title="Customer feedback form"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation"
  allow-full-screen="true"
  style="border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px;"
/>
```

Key props:

- `src` (string, required): URL of the external content.
- `width` / `height` (string): Dimensions in pixels or percentages.
- `title` (string): Accessible title for screen readers.
- `allow-full-screen` (boolean-like): Allow fullscreen where supported.
- `sandbox` (string): Space-separated sandbox restrictions.
- `priority` (boolean-like): Load immediately instead of lazy loading.
- `style` (string): Inline styles for borders and layout.

Use [Code and Groups](/components/code-blocks-and-groups) when you want to show iframe snippets as examples rather than render them.

## Advanced options

### Platform support

Commonly used video sources:

- **Video platforms:** YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Wistia
- **Video formats (HTML5):** MP4, WebM, OGG

Most platforms provide both a shareable URL and an iframe embed code; use whichever best matches your workflow (Web Editor block or MDX component).

### Accessibility and layout best practices

- Always set a meaningful `title` on `<Video>` (iframe mode) and `<Iframe>` for better screen reader support.
- Specify `width` and `height` to improve layout stability and avoid content shifting as media loads.
- Use responsive styles (for example, `style="width: 100%; max-width: 672px; height: auto;"`) so embeds look good on smaller screens.
- For important, above-the-fold media, consider `priority="true"` or `fetchPriority="high"`; otherwise, rely on lazy loading to keep pages fast.

### Security considerations for iframes

- Use the `sandbox` attribute on `<Iframe>` to limit what embedded content can do.
- Start with a restrictive value and add only what you need, for example:
  - `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation"`
- Only embed content from origins you trust, especially when allowing scripts or same-origin access.
