## Headings

Headings provide structure and create anchor targets used by inâ€‘page navigation. They also determine entries in the table of contents.

Use `#` symbols to create headers

```markdown
## Section

### Subsection

#### Detail (use H4 as the deepest level)
```

<Callout uid="9dc86e4a-ad54-42e2-ac1c-0aad001124dc" kind="info" collapsed="false">
  The page title renders as H1. Body headings typically begin at `##.`
</Callout>

## Paragraphs

Separate paragraphs with a blank line.

```markdown
This is a paragraph with one idea.

This is another paragraph that advances the topic.
```

## Inline emphasis

- Bold highlights labels, UI terms, or important actions.

- Italic introduces terms, references titles, or adds light emphasis.

- Strikethrough is rare; use only to indicate deprecation in changelogs.

- Inline code marks technical tokens (identifiers, commands, filenames, HTTP methods/paths); wrap with backticks.

| Style         | Usage                    | Result             |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Bold          | `**Create project**`     | **Create project** |
| Italic        | `*idempotent*`           | *idempotent*       |
| Strikethrough | `~~Legacy token~~`       | ~~Legacy token~~   |
| Inline code   | `` `GET /v1/projects` `` | `GET /v1/projects` |

## Links

### Internal links

Use explicit relative slugs rooted at the docs site.

```markdown
[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)
[Code blocks](/components/component-library/codeblock)
```

[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)
[Code blocks](/components/component-library/codeblock)

### External links

Use absolute URLs.

```markdown
[The AI Documentation](https://documentation.ai/)
```

## Line breaks and spacing

### Paragraph breaks

Paragraph break: leave a blank line between paragraphs.

```markdown
First paragraph.

Second paragraph.
```

First paragraph.

Second paragraph.

### Manual line breaks

Manual line break: insert `<br />` sparingly for controlled breaks inside a paragraph (avoid for layout).

```markdown
First line with an intentional break.<br />
Second line continues the same paragraph.
```

First line with an intentional break.\
Second line continues the same paragraph.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
Avoid stacking multiple blank lines. Use headings and paragraphs for structure, not repeated breaks.
</Callout>
