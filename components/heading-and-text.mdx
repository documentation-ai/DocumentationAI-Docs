## Overview

Structure your content with headings, paragraphs, inline emphasis, and links. All standard Markdown text formatting is supported. The page title renders as H1, so body headings typically begin at `##`.

## Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headers for structure and navigation:

````markdown
## Section
### Subsection  
#### Detail (use H4 as deepest level)
````

## Paragraphs

Separate paragraphs with a blank line:

````markdown
This is a paragraph with one idea.

This is another paragraph that advances the topic.
````

This is a paragraph with one idea.

This is another paragraph that advances the topic.

## Inline emphasis

| Style         | Syntax                   | Result             |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Bold          | `**Create project**`     | **Create project** |
| Italic        | `*idempotent*`           | *idempotent*       |
| Strikethrough | `~~Legacy token~~`       | ~~Legacy token~~   |
| Inline code   | `` `GET /v1/projects` `` | `GET /v1/projects` |

### Style effects

- **Bold** - Renders text in strong weight for emphasis
- *Italic* - Renders text in slanted style for subtle emphasis  
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - Renders text with line through for deletions/deprecation
- `Inline code` - Renders text in monospace font with background highlight

## Links

### Internal links

Use relative slugs rooted at the docs site:

````markdown
[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)
[Components](/components/component-library/callout)
````

[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)
[Components](/components/component-library/callout)

### External links

Use absolute URLs:

````markdown
[Documentation.AI](https://documentation.ai/)
````

[Documentation.AI](https://documentation.ai/)

## Line breaks and spacing

### Paragraph breaks

Leave a blank line between paragraphs:

````markdown
First paragraph.

Second paragraph.
````

First paragraph.

Second paragraph.

### Manual line breaks

Insert `<br />` for controlled breaks within a paragraph:

````markdown
First line with an intentional break.<br />
Second line continues the same paragraph.
````

First line with an intentional break.<br />
Second line continues the same paragraph.

  Avoid stacking multiple blank lines. Use headings and paragraphs for structure, not repeated breaks.
