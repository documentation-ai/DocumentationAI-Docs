## Overview

Lists and tables help you structure content so readers can quickly scan procedures, options, and structured data.

- **Lists** are best for sequences and grouped items:
  - Use ordered lists for step-by-step procedures or rankings.
  - Use unordered lists for features, options, or requirements.
  - Use nested lists to show hierarchy or sub-tasks.
- **Tables** are best when you need to compare fields, options, or statuses in a grid.

In Documentation.AI pages, lists and tables work alongside other components:

- For detailed, numbered procedures, consider using [`<Steps>`](/components/steps) instead of a long ordered list.
- For inline notes or warnings around lists and tables, use [`<Callout>`](/components/callout).
- For code-heavy content, combine lists/tables with code examples from [`Code and Groups`](/components/code-blocks-and-groups).

You can add lists and tables either through the **Web Editor** or by writing **Markdown/MDX** in the **Code Editor**.

## Using with Web Editor

Use the Web Editor when you prefer a visual, WYSIWYG-style workflow.

### Insert and manage lists

1. Place your cursor on a new line.
2. Type <kbd>/</kbd> to open the block menu.
3. Under **Lists & Formatting**, choose:
   - **Bullet List** (unordered)
   - **Numbered List** (ordered)
4. Start typing your first item.

Then:

- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create the next item.
- Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to create a **nested** list under the current item.
- Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to outdent and move back up a level.

You can also switch an existing paragraph to a list (or back to a paragraph) using the block dropdown on the left of the line.

<Callout kind="info">

Prefer writing in code?

You can switch to **MDX view inside the Web Editor** to write or edit this component using the same syntax as the Code Editor. This is useful if you want full control while staying in the Web Editor.

</Callout>

### Insert and manage tables

1. Place your cursor on a new line.
2. Type <kbd>/</kbd> to open the block menu.
3. Select **Table**.

A basic table is inserted:

- The **first row** is the **header row**. Text in this row is styled as headings (bold).
- From the **second row onward**, you can enter regular cell content.

#### Row controls

Hover near the left edge of a row to reveal the row toolbar:

- **H** – Toggle header styling on or off for that row.
- **Up/Down arrows** – Move the current row up or down.
- **Trash** (when present) – Delete the row.

Use these controls to:

- Turn a content row into a header row or demote it back.
- Reorder rows without copy-paste.

#### Column controls

Hover over the top of a column to reveal the column toolbar (three-dot icon):

- Change **alignment** for the column (left, center, or right).
- Move the column left or right using the arrows.
- Delete the column if you no longer need it.

If you need more complex, API-style tables, you can also use dedicated components like [`<ParamField>`](/components/paramfield) and [`<ResponseField>`](/components/responsefield).

## Using with Code Editor

Use the Code Editor when you want full control over Markdown/MDX syntax or when working from a Git workflow. Lists and tables use standard Markdown syntax and render the same way as content created via the Web Editor.

### Lists

#### Ordered lists

Use numbers followed by periods:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

Renders as:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

<Callout kind="info">

Markdown automatically sequences ordered lists. You can use `1.` for every item, and it will still render in order.

</Callout>

#### Unordered lists

Use dashes, asterisks, or plus signs:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Renders as:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

For consistency across your docs, prefer using `-` for unordered lists.

#### Nested lists

Indent nested items with spaces (commonly 2 or 4 spaces). Tabs also work, but spaces are more predictable in version control.

```markdown
1. First item
   - Nested unordered item
   - Another nested item
2. Second item
   1. Nested ordered item
   2. Another nested ordered item
3. Third item
```

Renders as:

1. First item
   - Nested unordered item
   - Another nested item
2. Second item
   1. Nested ordered item
   2. Another nested ordered item
3. Third item

<Callout kind="alert">

Mixing different unordered markers (`-`, `*`, `+`) within the same list can cause inconsistent rendering across Markdown parsers. Stick to a single marker per list.

</Callout>

For long, multi-step procedures, consider using the [`Steps` component](/components/steps), which gives you more control over step titles and icons.

### Tables

#### Basic table syntax

Use pipes (`|`) to separate columns and dashes (`-`) to define the header row:

```markdown
| Feature        | Description         | Status      |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Authentication | User login system   | Complete    |
| Dashboard      | Main user interface | In progress |
| Reports        | Data analytics      | Planned     |
```

Renders as:

| Feature        | Description         | Status      |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Authentication | User login system   | Complete    |
| Dashboard      | Main user interface | In progress |
| Reports        | Data analytics      | Planned     |

#### Alignment and readability

You can add colons to the header separator row to control alignment:

```markdown
| Name  | Role      | Status   |
| :---- | :-------- | -------: |
| Alice | Developer | Active   |
| Bob   | Designer  | Inactive |
```

- `:----` makes a column left-aligned.
- `:----:` makes a column center-aligned.
- `----:` makes a column right-aligned.

It is not required to perfectly align the pipes in your raw Markdown, but it can make tables easier to edit in code.

## Advanced options

### Indentation and nested content

When nesting lists:

- Use consistent indentation (for example, 2 or 4 spaces) for each nesting level.
- Avoid mixing tabs and spaces within the same list.
- Keep nested lists short; if you need deep hierarchies, consider using [`Expandables`](/components/expandables) or separate sections instead.

### Table formatting best practices

- Keep column labels short and scannable; use separate paragraphs or [`Callout`](/components/callout) for long explanations.
- Prefer multiple smaller tables over one very wide table that may require horizontal scrolling.
- For API schemas or complex field documentation, use the dedicated [`API Components`](/components/api-components) instead of hand-written Markdown tables.
