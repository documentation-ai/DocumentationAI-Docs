## Overview

Expandables let you hide detailed content behind a clickable title. They are useful anywhere you want **progressive disclosure** in your docs instead of long, uninterrupted sections.

Use expandables to:

- Build FAQ sections where each question expands to show the answer
- Tuck away optional configuration details or advanced settings
- Hide long troubleshooting sections until they are needed
- Group related details under a shared heading

In Documentation.AI you can add expandables in two ways:

- **Web Editor** – Insert Expandable / Expandable Group blocks from the slash menu.
- **Code Editor (MDX)** – Use the `<Expandable>` and `<ExpandableGroup>` components.

You can freely mix expandables with other components such as [`Callout`](/components/callout) and [`Steps`](/components/steps) to create richer, more scannable pages.

<Expandable title="Example expandable" default-open="false">
  This is a simple expandable created with the component.\
  You can add text, lists, images, callouts, steps, and more inside.

</Expandable>

## Using with Web Editor

In the Web Editor, Expandable and Expandable Group are available as blocks from the slash menu.

### Add a single expandable

1. Place your cursor on a new line where you want the collapsible section.
2. Type <kbd>/</kbd> and search for **Expandable**.
3. Select **Expandable** to insert an accordion-style block.
4. Click the **title text** in the header to rename it.
5. Click inside the **content area** to start adding body content.

Each expandable has:

- A **title row** – what readers click to open or close the section.
- A **content area** – where you can add rich content such as text, images, [`Callout`](/components/callout), or [`Steps`](/components/steps).

<Callout kind="info">

Prefer writing in code?

You can switch to **MDX view inside the Web Editor** to write or edit this component using the same syntax as the Code Editor. This is useful if you want full control while staying in the Web Editor.

</Callout>

### Control default open or closed

For each expandable block:

- Use the **expand/collapse icon** on the right side of the header to set the **default state**.
- When you click it while open, the tooltip shows **“Set Default State to Collapsed”** (and vice versa).
- The default state only affects how the page appears **when it first loads**; readers can still open and close it.

### Add and manage an expandable group

Use **Expandable Group** when you want multiple expandables that belong together, such as an FAQ list or a set of configuration topics.

To add and manage a group:

1. Place your cursor on a new line.
2. Type <kbd>/</kbd> and search for **Expandable Group**, then insert it.
3. Inside the group:
   - Use the **<kbd>+</kbd> button** at the bottom of the group to add another item.
   - Click the **trash icon** on an item to delete just that expandable.
   - Use the **drag handle** to reorder items.
   - Edit titles and content just like a single expandable.

Expandable Group ensures consistent spacing, borders, and behavior across all items in the group.

## Using with Code Editor

In the Code Editor (MDX), you work directly with the `<Expandable>` and `<ExpandableGroup>` components.

### `<Expandable>` component

Use `<Expandable>` for a single collapsible section.

```jsx
<Expandable title="Click to expand" default-open="false">
  Add your content here...
</Expandable>
```

The two main attributes are:

- `title` – text shown in the header that users click.
- `default-open` – `"true"` to start open, `"false"` to start closed (defaults to `"false"`).

```jsx
<Expandable title="Getting started guide" default-open="true">
  This section starts open by default and is useful for key onboarding content.
</Expandable>
```

Expandables can contain rich content including lists, code blocks, [`Callout`](/components/callout), and [`Steps`](/components/steps):

````jsx
<Expandable title="API configuration" default-open="false">
## Environment variables

Set these variables in your `.env` file:

- `API_KEY` - Your API authentication key
- `API_URL` - Base URL for API calls

```bash
# Example .env file
API_KEY=your-secret-key
API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

<Callout kind="danger">
  Never commit API keys to version control.
</Callout>
</Expandable>
````

### `<ExpandableGroup>` component

Use `<ExpandableGroup>` to group multiple `<Expandable>` components together with consistent styling.

````jsx
<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Installation" default-open="true">
    Install the package using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    npm install documentation-ai
    ```
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Configuration" default-open="false">
    Create a configuration file in your project root:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "My Documentation",
      "theme": "light",
      "sidebar": true
    }
    ```
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Deployment" default-open="false">
    Deploy your documentation using the CLI:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>
````

`<ExpandableGroup>` itself does not take any attributes; it is a simple wrapper that applies layout and spacing to the child `<Expandable>` components.

### Attribute reference

<ParamField path="title" param-type="string" required="false" deprecated="false">
  Header text displayed in the expandable button (default: `"Click to expand"`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="default-open" param-type="string" required="false" deprecated="false">
  Initial state: `"true"` (open) or `"false"` (closed). Defaults to `"false"`.
</ParamField>

## Advanced options

### Content and layout best practices

- **Use for progressive disclosure**  
  Keep pages scannable by showing only the essentials by default, and placing advanced details or edge cases in expandables.

- **Keep titles short and specific**  
  Aim for clear, action-oriented titles such as `"Advanced configuration"`, `"Troubleshooting"`, or `"See full example"` rather than full sentences.

- **Avoid nesting deeply**  
  While you can place many components (including [`Callout`](/components/callout) and [`Steps`](/components/steps)) inside an expandable, avoid deeply nested expandables or many layers of headings, which can be harder to navigate.

- **Use groups for related items**  
  Prefer `<ExpandableGroup>` when you have several related items so spacing, borders, and behavior feel consistent.

### Behavioral notes and limitations

- Expandables control **only visibility**, not navigation; readers cannot link directly to an individual expandable item unless you add an anchor heading inside the content.
- The `default-open` state is evaluated on initial page load only. User open/close actions are not persisted across sessions.
- `<ExpandableGroup>` does not currently support additional props such as single-open-only or auto-close behavior; all items expand and collapse independently.
